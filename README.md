# JCARLO
This is the latest project I have been working on which surged from my interest in learning more about machine learning and its capabilities. The goal of JCARLO is to help researchers and scholars find original sources for citation usage. Therefore, being able to find the original publication or article from a brief description provided by the user. To achieve its mission, JCARLO uses an asymmetric semantic search model combined with dot-product similarity search which allows it to reliably find the best match out of an extensive database of embeddings.
