Delivery of exogenous functional mitochondria into damaged cells has been proposed as a mechanism of cell transplant and physiological repair for damaged tissue. We here demonstrated that isolated mitochondria can be transferred into homogeneic and xenogeneic cells by simple co-incubation using genetically labelled mitochondria, and elucidated the mechanism and the effect of direct mitochondrial transfer. Intracellular localization of exogenous mitochondria was confirmed by PCR, real-time PCR, live fluorescence imaging, three-dimensional reconstruction imaging, continuous time-lapse microscopic observation, flow cytometric analysis and immunoelectron microscopy. Isolated homogeneic mitochondria were transferred into human uterine endometrial gland-derived mesenchymal cells in a dose-dependent manner. Moreover, mitochondrial transfer rescued the mitochondrial respiratory function and improved the cellular viability in mitochondrial DNA-depleted cells and these effects lasted several days. Finally, we discovered that mitochondrial internalization involves macropinocytosis. In conclusion, these data support direct transfer of exogenous mitochondria as a promising approach for the treatment of various diseases.}},

Then we quantitated the bioenergetics consequences of non‐autologous mitochondrial transplantation into cardiomyocytes up to 28 days using a Seahorse Extracellular Flux Analyzer. Compared with the control, we observed a statistically significant improvement in basal respiration and ATP production 2‐day post‐transplantation, accompanied by an increase in maximal respiration and spare respiratory capacity, although not statistically significantly. However, these initial improvements were short‐lived and the bioenergetics advantages return to the baseline level in subsequent time points. This study, for the first time, shows that transplantation of non‐autologous mitochondria from healthy skeletal muscle cells into normal cardiomyocytes leads to short‐term improvement of bioenergetics indicating “supercharged” state. However, over time these improved effects disappear, which suggests transplantation of mitochondria may have a potential application in settings where there is an acute stress.}},

The importance of this issue is highlighted when we know that mitochondrial dysfunction can be observed in a variety of diseases such as cardiovascular diseases, neurodegenerative diseases, ischemia, diabetes, renal failure, skeletal muscles disorders, liver diseases, burns, aging, and cancer progression.

abstract = {{Emerging evidence indicates that reprogramming of energy metabolism involving disturbances in energy production from a defect in cellular respiration with a shift to glycolysis is a core hallmark of cancer. Alterations in cancer cell energy metabolism are linked to abnormalities in mitochondrial function. Mitochondrial dysfunction of cancer cells includes increased glycolysis, decreased apoptosis, and resistance to radiotherapy. The study was designed for two main points: firstly, to investigate whether exogenous functional mitochondria can transfer into glioma cells and explore the underlying molecular mechanisms from the perspective of endocytosis; secondly, to further verify whether the mitochondrial transplantation is able to rescue aerobic respiration, attenuate the Warburg effect and enhance the radiosensitivity of gliomas. Methods: Mitochondria were isolated from normal human astrocytes (HA) and immediately co-incubated with starved human glioma cells (U87). Confocal microscopy and gene sequencing were performed to evaluate the ability of isolated mitochondria internalization into U87 cells. The interaction between endocytosis and isolated mitochondria transfer were captured by 3D tomographic microscopy and transmission electron microscopy. NAD+, CD38, cADPR and Ca2+ release were determined by commercial kits, western blot, HLPC-MS and Fluo-3 AM respectively. PCR array expression profiling and Seahorse XF analysis were used to evaluate the effect of mitochondrial transplantation on energy phenotypes of U87 cells. U87 cells and U87 xenografts were both treated with mitochondrial transplantation, radiation, or a combination of mitochondrial transplantation and radiation. Apoptosis in vitro and in vivo were detected by cytochrome C, cleaved caspase 9 and TUNEL staining. Results: We found that mitochondria from HA could be transferred into starved U87 cells by simple co-incubation. Starvation treatment slowed the rate of glycolysis and decreased the transformation of NAD+ to NADH in U87 cells. A large amount of accumulated NAD+ was released into the extracellular space. CD38 is a member of the NAD+ glycohydrolase family that catalyzes the cyclization of extracellular NAD+ to intracellular cADPR. cADPR triggered release of Ca2+ to promote cytoskeleton remodeling and plasma membrane invagination. Thus, endocytosis involving isolated mitochondria internalization was mediated by NAD+-CD38-cADPR-Ca2+ signaling. Mitochondrial transfer enhanced gene and protein expression related to the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, increased aerobic respiration, attenuated glycolysis, reactivated the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway, inhibited malignant proliferation of U87 cells. Isolated mitochondria injected into U87 xenograft tumors also entered cells, and inhibited glioma growth in nude mice. Mitochondrial transplantation could enhance the radiosensitivity of gliomas in vitro and in vivo. Conclusion: These findings suggested that starvation-induced endocytosis via NAD+-CD38-cADPR-Ca2+ signaling could be a new mechanism of mitochondrial transplantation to rescue aerobic respiration and attenuate the Warburg effect. This mechanism could be a promising approach for radiosensitization.}},

These cells can be used to investigate the role of mitochondria in various cellular processes such as cell death and senescence. Mitochondria are not only the 'powerhouse' of the cell; they are also involved in a multitude of processes that include calcium storage, the cell cycle and cell death. Traditional means of investigating mitochondrial importance in a given cellular process have centered upon depletion of mtDNA through chemical or genetic means. Although these methods severely disrupt the mitochondrial electron transport chain, mtDNA-depleted cells still maintain mitochondria and many mitochondrial functions. Here we describe a straightforward protocol to generate mammalian cell populations with low to nondetectable levels of mitochondria. Ectopic expression of the ubiquitin E3 ligase Parkin, combined with short-term mitochondrial uncoupler treatment, stimulates widespread mitophagy and effectively eliminates mitochondria. In this protocol, we explain how to generate Parkin-expressing, mitochondria-depleted cells from scratch in 23 d, as well as offer a variety of methods for confirming mitochondrial clearance. Furthermore, we describe culture conditions to maintain mitochondrial-depleted cells for up to 30 d with minimal loss of viability, for longitudinal studies. This method should prove useful for investigating the importance of mitochondria in a variety of biological processes.}},

Mitochondrial transplantation replaces damaged mitochondria and enhances myocardial function and tissue viability. Herein we investigated the efficacy of mitochondrial transplantation in enhancing graft function and viability after prolonged CIT. METHODS Heterotopic heart transplantation was performed in C57BL/6J mice. Upon heart harvesting from C57BL/6J donors, 0.5 ml of either mitochondria (1 × 108 in respiration buffer; mitochondria group) or respiration buffer (vehicle group) was delivered antegrade to the coronary arteries via injection to the coronary ostium. The hearts were excised and preserved for 29 ± 0.3 hours in cold saline (4°C). The hearts were then heterotopically transplanted. A second injection of either mitochondria (1 × 108) or respiration buffer (vehicle) was delivered antegrade to the coronary arteries 5 minutes after transplantation. Grafts were analyzed for 24 hours. Beating score, graft function, and tissue injury were measured. RESULTS Beating score, calculated ejection fraction, and shortening fraction were significantly enhanced (p < 0.05), whereas necrosis and neutrophil infiltration were significantly decreased (p < 0.05) in the mitochondria group as compared with the vehicle group at 24 hours of reperfusion. Transmission electron microscopy showed the presence of contraction bands in vehicle but not in mitochondria grafts. CONCLUSIONS Mitochondrial transplantation prolongs CIT to 29 hours in the murine heart transplantation model, significantly enhances graft function, and decreases graft tissue injury. Mitochondrial transplantation may provide a means to reduce graft failure and improve transplantation outcomes after prolonged CIT.}},

Hence, here we tried to further clarify the role of mitochondria in cancer by transferring healthy mitochondria to cancer cells, and also to cells with depleted mitochondrial DNA (ρ0). Healthy mitochondria were isolated from WI-38 cells and were transferred to HeLa, SAS, HeLa ρ0, and SAS ρ0 cells. Then, cell proliferation was verified. In addition, the cells were treated by different concentrations of cisplatin and assessed for apoptosis induction and quantifying the mRNA expression of apoptosis-related genes. Results revealed that incubation of the HeLa, SAS and HeLa ρ0 cells with 5 µg/ml of the isolated mitochondria for 24 h significantly (p < 0.001) increased cell proliferation compared to non-treated controls. Interestingly, the mitochondria transfer rescued the ρ0 cells and made them capable of growing under conventional culture medium. However, the number of apoptotic cells was significantly higher in the HeLa ρ0 cells that received the mitochondria (HeLa-Fibro-Mit) compared to the HeLa ρ0. Furthermore, the expression level of BCL-2 anti-apoptotic gene was down-regulated in both HeLa-Fibro-Mit and SAS-Fibro-Mit cell lines while the expression levels of the BAX, caspase8, caspase9, and AIF pro-apoptotic genes were upregulated. Our findings indicated that although the response of cancer cells to the mitochondria transfer is cancer-type dependent, but the introduction of normal exogenous mitochondria to some cancer cells might be considered as a potential novel therapeutic strategy.}},

Although critical to life, energy production is not the only function of mitochondria, and the composition of this organelle is tailored to meet the specific needs of each cell type. As an organelle, the mitochondrion has been a popular subject for proteomic analysis, but quantitative proteomic methods have yet to be applied to tease apart subtle differences among mitochondria from different tissues or muscle types. Here we used mass spectrometry-based proteomics to analyze mitochondrial proteins extracted from rat skeletal muscle, heart, and liver tissues. Based on 689 proteins identified with high confidence, mitochondria from the different tissues are qualitatively quite similar. However, striking differences emerged from the quantitative comparison of protein abundance between the tissues. Furthermore we applied similar methods to analyze mitochondrial matrix and intermembrane space proteins extracted from the same mitochondrial source, providing evidence for the submitochondrial localization of a number of proteins in skeletal muscle and liver. Several proteins not previously thought to reside in mitochondria were identified, and their presence in this organelle was confirmed by protein correlation profiling. Hierarchical clustering of microarray expression data provided further evidence that some of the novel mitochondrial candidates identified in the proteomic survey might be associated with mitochondria. These data reveal several important distinctions between mitochondrial and submitochondrial proteomes from skeletal muscle, heart, and liver tissue sources. Indeed approximately one-third of the proteins identified in the soluble fractions are associated predominantly to one of the three tissues, indicating a tissue-dependent regulation of mitochondrial proteins. Furthermore a small percentage of the mitochondrial proteome is unique to each tissue.}},

The mechanisms controlling mitochondrial calcium homeostasis have been recently unraveled with the discovery of mitochondrial inner membrane proteins that regulate mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake and extrusion. Mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake depends on a large complex of proteins centered around the Ca2+ channel protein, mitochondrial Ca2+ uniporter (MCU) in close interactions with several regulatory subunits (MCUb, EMRE, MICU1, MICU2). Mitochondrial Ca2+ extrusion is mainly mediated by the mitochondrial Na+/Ca2+/Li+ exchanger (NCLX).

Unsurprisingly, mitochondrial dysfunction results in wide range of disorders. Understanding how cells adapt to changes in mitochondrial function is critical for the evaluation of mitochondrial disorders and the development of potential treatments.

Stem cells also need to remain functionally plastic (i.e. to have the ability to “decide” whether to remain quiescent or to undergo activation upon signaling cues to support tissue function and homeostasis). Mitochondrial plasticity is thought to enable this reshaping of stem cell functions, integrating signaling cues with stem cell outcomes. Indeed, recent evidence highlights the crucial role of maintaining mitochondrial plasticity for stem cell biology. For example, tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle metabolites generated and metabolized in the mitochondria serve as cofactors for epigenetic enzymes, thereby coupling mitochondrial metabolism and transcriptional regulation. Another layer of mitochondrial plasticity has emerged, pointing toward mitochondrial dynamics in regulating stem cell fate decisions. Imposing imbalanced mitochondrial dynamics by manipulating the expression levels of the key molecular regulators of this process influences cellular outcomes by changing the nuclear transcriptional program. Moreover, reactive oxygen species have also been shown to play an important role in regulating transcriptional profiles in stem cells. In this review, we focus on recent findings demonstrating that mitochondria are essential regulators of stem cell activation and fate decisions.

Here, we evaluate mtDNA retention in new host cells using ‘MitoPunch’, a device that transfers isolated mitochondria into mouse and human cells. We show that newly introduced mtDNA is stably retained in mtDNA-deficient (ρ0) recipient cells following uridine-free selection, although exogenous mtDNA is lost from metabolically impaired, mtDNA-intact (ρ+) cells. We then introduced a second selective pressure by transferring chloramphenicol-resistant mitochondria into chloramphenicol-sensitive, metabolically impaired ρ+ mouse cybrid cells. Following double selection, recipient cells with mismatched nuclear (nDNA) and mitochondrial (mtDNA) genomes retained transferred mtDNA, which replaced the endogenous mutant mtDNA and improved cell respiration. However, recipient cells with matched mtDNA-nDNA failed to retain transferred mtDNA and sustained impaired respiration. Our results suggest that exogenous mtDNA retention in metabolically impaired ρ+ recipients depends on the degree of recipient mtDNA-nDNA co-evolution. Uncovering factors that stabilize exogenous mtDNA integration will improve our understanding of in vivo mitochondrial transfer and the interplay between mitochondrial and nuclear genomes.}},

Nonetheless their use may prove challenging as incomplete differentiation of these cells might lead to tumoregenicity. Interestingly, many cancer types have been reported to display metabolic modifications with features that might be similar to stem cells. Understanding the metabolic properties of human pluripotent stem cells when compared to their differentiated counterparts can thus be of crucial importance. Furthermore recent data has stressed distinct features of different human pluripotent cells lines, namely when comparing embryo-derived human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) and induced pluripotent stem cells (IPSCs) reprogrammed from somatic cells. We compared the energy metabolism of hESCs, IPSCs, and their somatic counterparts. Focusing on mitochondria, we tracked organelle localization and morphology. Furthermore we performed gene expression analysis of several pathways related to the glucose metabolism, including glycolysis, the pentose phosphate pathway and the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. In addition we determined oxygen consumption rates (OCR) using a metabolic extracellular flux analyzer, as well as total intracellular ATP levels by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Finally we explored the expression of key proteins involved in the regulation of glucose metabolism. Our results demonstrate that, although the metabolic signature of IPSCs is not identical to that of hESCs, nonetheless they cluster with hESCs rather than with their somatic counterparts. ATP levels, lactate production and OCR revealed that human pluripotent cells rely mostly on glycolysis to meet their energy demands. Furthermore, our work points to some of the strategies which human pluripotent stem cells may use to maintain high glycolytic rates, such as high levels of hexokinase II and inactive pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH).}},

However, as the developmental stages proceed, cardiac mesodermal cells are differentiated into various types of cells via cardiac progenitors and demonstrate different programming in transcriptional network and epigenetic regulation in a spatiotemporal manner. In fact, the metabolic feature also changes dramatically during heart development and cardiac differentiation. Researchers reported that each type of cell exhibits different metabolic features that can be used to specifically identify them. Metabolism is a critical process for generating energy and biomass in all living cells and organisms and has been long regarded as a passenger, rather than an active driver, for intracellular status. However, recent studies revealed that metabolism influences self-renewal and cell fate specification via epigenetic changes directly or indirectly. Metabolism mirrors the physiological status of the cell and endogenous cellular activity; therefore, understanding the metabolic signature of each cell type serves as a guide for innovative methods of selecting and differentiating desired cell types.

Here, we aim to define the energetic requirements for and the metabolic microenvironment needed to support the cardiac differentiation of embryonic stem cells. We demonstrate that anaerobic glycolytic metabolism, while sufficient for embryonic stem cell homeostasis, must be transformed into the more efficient mitochondrial oxidative metabolism to secure cardiac specification and excitation-contraction coupling. This energetic switch was programmed by rearrangement of the metabolic transcriptome that encodes components of glycolysis, fatty acid oxidation, the Krebs cycle, and the electron transport chain. Modifying the copy number of regulators of mitochondrial fusion and fission resulted in mitochondrial maturation and network expansion, which in turn provided an energetic continuum to supply nascent sarcomeres. Disrupting respiratory chain function prevented mitochondrial organization and compromised the energetic infrastructure, causing deficient sarcomerogenesis and contractile malfunction.

In multiple models of senescence, absence of mitochondria reduced a spectrum of senescence effectors and phenotypes while preserving ATP production via enhanced glycolysis. Global transcriptomic analysis by RNA sequencing revealed that a vast number of senescent‐associated changes are dependent on mitochondria, particularly the pro‐inflammatory phenotype. Mechanistically, we show that the ATM, Akt and mTORC1 phosphorylation cascade integrates signals from the DNA damage response (DDR) towards PGC‐1β‐dependent mitochondrial biogenesis, contributing to a ROS‐mediated activation of the DDR and cell cycle arrest. Finally, we demonstrate that the reduction in mitochondrial content in vivo, by either mTORC1 inhibition or PGC‐1β deletion, prevents senescence in the ageing mouse liver.

Disrupting mitochondrial respiration significantly blocked spermatogonial differentiation. Inhibition of glucose conversion to glucose-6-phosphate or pentose phosphate pathway also repressed the formation of c-Kit+ differentiating germ cells, suggesting that metabolites produced from glycolysis are required for spermatogonial differentiation.

The range of cardiac defects associated with TBX5 mutations in humans suggests multiple roles for the transcription factor in cardiac development and function. Animal models demonstrate similar defects and have provided a useful platform for investigating the roles of TBX5 during embryonic development. During early cardiac development, TBX5 appears to act primarily as a transcriptional activator of genes associated with cardiomyocyte maturation and upstream of morphological signals for septation. During later cardiac development, TBX5 is required for patterning of the cardiac conduction system and maintenance of mature cardiomyocyte function. A comprehensive understanding of the integral roles of TBX5 throughout cardiac development and adult life will be critical for understanding human cardiac morphology and function.}},

Despite displaying key cardiomyocyte phenotypic characteristics, they more closely resemble fetal/neonatal cardiomyocytes and are still immature, these cells mainly rely on glucose as a substrate for metabolic energy, while mature cardiomyocytes mainly employ oxidative phosphorylation of fatty acids. Studies showed that the alteration of metabolism pattern from glycolysis to oxidative phosphorylation improve the maturity of hiPSC-CMs. As a transcription factor, accumulating evidences showed the important role of Nrf2 in the regulation of energy metabolism, which directly regulates the expression of mitochondrial respiratory complexes. Therefore, we hypothesized that Nrf2 is involved in the maturation of hiPSC-CMs.</p><h2>Methods</h2> <p>The morphological and functional changes related to mitochondria and cell maturation were analyzed by knock-down and activation of Nrf2.</p><h2>Results</h2> <p>The results showed that the inhibition of Nrf2 led to the retardation of cell maturation. The activation of Nrf2 leads to a more mature hiPSC-CMs phenotype, as indicated by the increase of cardiac maturation markers, sarcomere length, calcium transient dynamics, the number and fusion events of mitochondria, and mitochondrial respiration. Bioinformatics analysis showed that in addition to metabolism-related genes, Nrf2 also activates the expression of myocardial ion channels.</p><h2>Conclusions</h2> <p>These findings indicated that Nrf2 plays an important role in the maturation of hiPSC-CMs. The present work provides greater insights into the molecular regulation of hiPSC-CM metabolism and theoretical basis in drug screening, disease modeling and alternative treatment.</p>}},

Both control cells and early passage patient-derived cells express a normal complement of SD and COX subunit proteins. Ethidium bromide treatment of normal cells and in vitro cell proliferation of patient-derived cells caused both populations to acquire identical Rho0 phenotypes. As expected, they lack mtDNA-encoded subunits COX-I and COX-II. In contrast, nDNA-encoded subunits are affected differentially, with some (COX-VIc) lacking and others (COX-IV, COX-Va, SD 30 and SD 70) maintained at somewhat reduced levels. We suggest that the differential stability of nDNA-encoded subunits in the absence of intact enzyme complexes is due to the ability of some, but not all, subunits to associate as partial complexes in the absence of mtDNA-encoded subunits.}},

Initially we confirmed that respiratory-competent cells can be produced following incubation of HOS cells lacking mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) with functional exogenous mitochondria and selection in a restrictive medium. Treatment of HOS cells with inhibitors of different endocytic pathways suggest that uptake of EGFP-labelled mitochondria occurs via an actin-dependent endocytic pathway which is consistent with macropinocytosis. We later utilised time-lapse microscopy to show that internalised mitochondria were found in large, motile cellular vesicles. Finally, we used confocal imaging to show that EGFP-labelled mitochondria colocalise with a macropinocytic cargo molecule during internalisation, HOS cells produce membrane ruffles interacting with external mitochondria during uptake and EGFP-labelled mitochondria are found within early macropinosomes inside cells. In conclusion our results are consistent with isolated mitochondria being internalised by macropinocytosis in HOS cells.}},

PANTHER/LIB is a collection of “books,” each representing a protein family as a multiple sequence alignment, a Hidden Markov Model (HMM), and a family tree. Functional divergence within the family is represented by dividing the tree into subtrees based on shared function, and by subtree HMMs. PANTHER/X is an abbreviated ontology for summarizing and navigating molecular functions and biological processes associated with the families and subfamilies. We apply PANTHER to three areas of active research. First, we report the size and sequence diversity of the families and subfamilies, characterizing the relationship between sequence divergence and functional divergence across a wide range of protein families. Second, we use the PANTHER/X ontology to give a high-level representation of gene function across the human and mouse genomes. Third, we use the family HMMs to rank missense single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), on a database-wide scale, according to their likelihood of affecting protein function.}},

Following 29 min of RI, autologously derived mitochondria (RI-mitochondria; 9.7 ± 1.7 × 106/ml) or vehicle alone (RI-vehicle) were injected directly into the RI zone, and the hearts were allowed to recover for 4 wk. Mitochondrial transplantation decreased (P < 0.05) creatine kinase MB, cardiac troponin-I, and apoptosis significantly in the RI zone. Infarct size following 4 wk of recovery was decreased significantly in RI-mitochondria (7.9 ± 2.9\%) compared with RI-vehicle (34.2 ± 3.3\%, P < 0.05). Serial echocardiograms showed that RI-mitochondria hearts returned to normal contraction within 10 min after reperfusion was started; however, RI-vehicle hearts showed persistent hypokinesia in the RI zone at 4 wk of recovery. Electrocardiogram and optical mapping studies showed that no arrhythmia was associated with autologously derived mitochondrial transplantation. In vivo and in vitro studies show that the transplanted mitochondria are evident in the interstitial spaces and are internalized by cardiomyocytes 2–8 h after transplantation. The transplanted mitochondria enhanced oxygen consumption, high-energy phosphate synthesis, and the induction of cytokine mediators and proteomic pathways that are important in preserving myocardial energetics, cell viability, and enhanced post-infarct cardiac function.

Examination of cellular bioenergetics corroborated with our metabolomic analysis, and demonstrated that somatic cells convert from an oxidative state to a glycolytic state in pluripotency. Interestingly, the bioenergetics of various somatic cells correlated with their reprogramming efficiencies. We further identified metabolites that differ between iPSCs and ESCs, which revealed novel metabolic pathways that play a critical role in regulating somatic cell reprogramming. Our findings are the first to globally analyze the metabolome of iPSCs, and provide mechanistic insight into a new layer of regulation involved in inducing pluripotency, and in evaluating iPSC and ESC equivalence.}},

Cell differentiation is associated with an increase in mitochondrial content and activity and with a metabolic shift toward increased oxidative phosphorylation activity. The opposite occurs during reprogramming of somatic cells into induced pluripotent stem cells. Studies have provided evidence of mitochondrial and metabolic changes during the differentiation of both embryonic and somatic (or adult) stem cells (SSCs), such as hematopoietic stem cells, mesenchymal stem cells, and tissue-specific progenitor cells. We thus propose to consider those mitochondrial and metabolic changes as hallmarks of differentiation processes. We review how mitochondrial biogenesis, dynamics, and function are directly involved in embryonic and SSC differentiation and how metabolic and sensing pathways connect mitochondria and metabolism with cell fate and pluripotency. Understanding the basis of the crosstalk between mitochondria and cell fate is of critical importance, given the promising application of stem cells in regenerative medicine. In addition to the development of novel strategies to improve the in vitro lineage-directed differentiation of stem cells, understanding the molecular basis of this interplay could lead to the identification of novel targets to improve the treatment of degenerative diseases.}},

As such, the activation of mitochondrial metabolism upon cellular differentiation was deemed a necessity to fuel the high metabolic needs of differentiated cells. However, recent studies have revealed a direct role for mitochondrial activity in the regulation of stem cell fate and differentiation. Several components of mitochondrial metabolism and respiration have now been shown to regulate different aspects of stem cell differentiation through signaling, transcriptional, proteomic and epigenetic modulations. In light of these findings mitochondrial metabolism is no longer considered a consequence of cellular differentiation, but rather a key regulatory mechanism of this process. This review will focus on recent progress that defines mitochondria as the epicenters for the regulation of stem cell fate decisions.}},

abstract = {{Background Many metabolites serve as important signalling molecules to adjust cellular activities and functions based on nutrient availability. Links between acetyl-CoA metabolism, histone lysine acetylation, and gene expression have been documented and studied over the past decade. In recent years, several additional acyl modifications to histone lysine residues have been identified, which depend on acyl-coenzyme A thioesters (acyl-CoAs) as acyl donors. Acyl-CoAs are intermediates of multiple distinct metabolic pathways, and substantial evidence has emerged that histone acylation is metabolically sensitive. Nevertheless, the metabolic sources of acyl-CoAs used for chromatin modification in most cases remain poorly understood. Elucidating how these diverse chemical modifications are coupled to and regulated by cellular metabolism is important in deciphering their functional significance. Scope of review In this article, we review the metabolic pathways that produce acyl-CoAs, as well as emerging evidence for functional roles of diverse acyl-CoAs in chromatin regulation. Because acetyl-CoA has been extensively reviewed elsewhere, we will focus on four other acyl-CoA metabolites integral to major metabolic pathways that are also known to modify histones: succinyl-CoA, propionyl-CoA, crotonoyl-CoA, and butyryl-CoA. We also briefly mention several other acyl-CoA species, which present opportunities for further research; malonyl-CoA, glutaryl-CoA, 3-hydroxybutyryl-CoA, 2-hydroxyisobutyryl-CoA, and lactyl-CoA. Each acyl-CoA species has distinct roles in metabolism, indicating the potential to report shifts in the metabolic status of the cell. For each metabolite, we consider the metabolic pathways in which it participates and the nutrient sources from which it is derived, the compartmentalisation of its metabolism, and the factors reported to influence its abundance and potential nuclear availability. We also highlight reported biological functions of these metabolically-linked acylation marks. Finally, we aim to illuminate key questions in acyl-CoA metabolism as they relate to the control of chromatin modification. Major conclusions A majority of acyl-CoA species are annotated to mitochondrial metabolic processes. Since acyl-CoAs are not known to be directly transported across mitochondrial membranes, they must be synthesized outside of mitochondria and potentially within the nucleus to participate in chromatin regulation. Thus, subcellular metabolic compartmentalisation likely plays a key role in the regulation of histone acylation. Metabolite tracing in combination with targeting of relevant enzymes and transporters will help to map the metabolic pathways that connect acyl-CoA metabolism to chromatin modification. The specific function of each acyl-CoA may be determined in part by biochemical properties that affect its propensity for enzymatic versus non-enzymatic protein modification, as well as the various enzymes that can add, remove and bind each modification. Further, competitive and inhibitory effects of different acyl-CoA species on these enzymes make determining the relative abundance of acyl-CoA species in specific contexts important to understand the regulation of chromatin acylation. An improved and more nuanced understanding of metabolic regulation of chromatin and its roles in physiological and disease-related processes will emerge as these questions are answered.}},

Mitochondria-deficient cells were resistant to the mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis, but efficiently died via tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-induced, RIPK3-dependent programmed necrosis or as a result of direct oligomerization of RIPK3. Although the ROS scavenger butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA) delayed TNF-induced necroptosis, it had no effect on necroptosis induced by RIPK3 oligomerization. Furthermore, although TNF-induced ROS production was dependent on mitochondria, the inhibition of TNF-induced necroptosis by BHA was observed in mitochondria-depleted cells. Our data indicate that mitochondrial ROS production accompanies, but does not cause, RIPK3-dependent necroptotic cell death.}},

Cardiac energy metabolism, specifically fatty acid and glucose metabolism, is altered in heart failure and has been implicated as a contributing factor in the impaired heart function observed in heart failure patients. There is emerging evidence demonstrating that correcting these changes in energy metabolism by modulating mitochondrial oxidative metabolism may be an effective treatment for heart failure. Promising strategies include the downregulation of fatty acid oxidation and an increased coupling of glycolysis to glucose oxidation. Carnitine palmitoyl transferase I (CPT1), fatty acid β-oxidation enzymes, and pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDK) are examples of metabolic targets for the treatment of heart failure. While targeting mitochondrial oxidative metabolism is a promising strategy to treat heart failure, further studies are needed to confirm the potential beneficial effect of modulating these metabolic targets as an approach to treating heart failure.

The tissue heterogeneity of the mammalian mitochondrial proteome. Am J Physiol Cell Physiol292: C689–C697, 2006), were analyzed using a canonical metabolic pathway approach as well as a functional domain homology analysis. These data were inserted into the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway framework to give global and metabolic pathway-specific information on the impact of the differential protein distribution on mitochondrial function. Custom pathway analysis was also performed using pathways limited to the mitochondrion. With the use of this approach, several well-known functional differences between these mitochondrial populations were confirmed. These included GABA metabolism in the brain, urea synthesis in the liver, and the domination of oxidative phosphorylation in the heart. By comparing relative protein amounts of mitochondria across tissues, a greater understanding of functional emphasis is possible as well as the nuclear “programming” required to enhance a given function within the mitochondria. For proteins determined to be mitochondrial and lacking a defined role functional domain BLAST analyses were performed. Several proteins associated with DNA structural modification and a novel CoA transferase were identified. A protein was also identified capable of catalyzing the first three steps of de novo pyrimidine synthesis. This analysis demonstrates that the distribution of nuclear encoded proteins significantly modifies the overall functional emphasis of the mitochondria to meet tissue-specific needs. These studies demonstrate the existence of mitochondrial biochemical functions that at present are poorly defined.}},

These changes in mitochondria may not simply be a response to cardiomyocyte maturation; the metabolic signals that occur throughout development may actually be central to the maturation process in cardiomyocytes.

Fatty acid treatment induces cardiomyocyte hypertrophy and significantly increases cardiomyocyte force production. The improvement in force generation is accompanied by enhanced calcium transient peak height and kinetics, and by increased action potential upstroke velocity and membrane capacitance. Fatty acids also enhance mitochondrial respiratory reserve capacity. RNA sequencing showed that fatty acid treatment upregulates genes involved in fatty acid β-oxidation and downregulates genes in lipid synthesis. Signal pathway analyses reveal that fatty acid treatment results in phosphorylation and activation of multiple intracellular kinases. Thus, fatty acids increase human cardiomyocyte hypertrophy, force generation, calcium dynamics, action potential upstroke velocity, and oxidative capacity.

These changes in energy metabolism have important impacts on the ability of the cardiomyocyte to proliferate during early cardiac development, as well as when cardiomyocytes terminally differentiate during later development. During early cardiac development, glycolysis is a major source of energy for proliferating cardiomyocytes. As cardiomyocytes mature and become terminally differentiated, mitochondrial oxidative capacity increases, with fatty acid β-oxidation becoming a major source of energy for the heart. The increase in mitochondrial oxidative capacity seems to coincide with a decrease in the proliferative ability of the cardiomyocyte. The switch from glycolysis to mitochondrial oxidative metabolism during cardiac development includes both alterations in the transcriptional control and acute alterations in the control of each pathway. Interestingly, if a hypertrophic stress is placed on the adult heart, cardiac energy metabolism switches to a more fetal phenotype, which includes an increase in glycolysis and decrease in mitochondrial fatty acid β-oxidation. In this article, we review the impact of alterations in energy substrate metabolism on cardiomyocyte proliferation, differentiation, and postnatal maturation.}},

abstract = {{Over the last decade, accumulating evidence has suggested a causative link between mitochondrial dysfunction and major phenotypes associated with aging. Somatic mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) mutations and respiratory chain dysfunction accompany normal aging, but the first direct experimental evidence that increased mtDNA mutation levels contribute to progeroid phenotypes came from the mtDNA mutator mouse. Recent evidence suggests that increases in aging-associated mtDNA mutations are not caused by damage accumulation, but rather are due to clonal expansion of mtDNA replication errors that occur during development. Here we discuss the caveats of the traditional mitochondrial free radical theory of aging and highlight other possible mechanisms, including insulin/IGF-1 signaling (IIS) and the target of rapamycin pathways, that underlie the central role of mitochondria in the aging process.}},

Advanced insights into disease mechanisms and therapeutic strategies require a deeper understanding of the molecular processes involved in the healthy heart. Knowledge of the full repertoire of cardiac cells and their gene expression profiles is a fundamental first step in this endeavour. Here, using state-of-the-art analyses of large-scale single-cell and single-nucleus transcriptomes, we characterize six anatomical adult heart regions. Our results highlight the cellular heterogeneity of cardiomyocytes, pericytes and fibroblasts, and reveal distinct atrial and ventricular subsets of cells with diverse developmental origins and specialized properties. We define the complexity of the cardiac vasculature and its changes along the arterio-venous axis. In the immune compartment, we identify cardiac-resident macrophages with inflammatory and protective transcriptional signatures. Furthermore, analyses of cell-to-cell interactions highlight different networks of macrophages, fibroblasts and cardiomyocytes between atria and ventricles that are distinct from those of skeletal muscle. Our human cardiac cell atlas improves our understanding of the human heart and provides a valuable reference for future studies.}},

The abundance of MitoCoP proteins covers six orders of magnitude and amounts to 7\% of the cellular proteome with the chaperones HSP60-HSP10 being the most abundant mitochondrial proteins. MitoCoP dynamics spans three orders of magnitudes, with half-lives from hours to months, and suggests a rapid regulation of biosynthesis and assembly processes. 460 MitoCoP genes are linked to human diseases with a strong prevalence for the central nervous system and metabolism.

abstract = {{A primary limitation in the use of pluripotent stem cell‐derived cardiomyocytes (PSC‐CMs) for both patient health and scientific investigation is the failure of these cells to achieve full functional maturity. In vivo, cardiomyocytes undergo numerous adaptive structural, functional and metabolic changes during maturation. By contrast, PSC‐CMs fail to fully undergo these developmental processes, instead remaining arrested at an embryonic stage of maturation. There is thus a significant need to understand the biological processes underlying proper CM maturation in vivo. Here, we discuss what is known regarding the initiation and coordination of CM maturation. We postulate that there is a critical perinatal window, ranging from embryonic day 18.5 to postnatal day 14 in mice, in which the maturation process is exquisitely sensitive to perturbation. While the initiation mechanisms of this process are unknown, it is increasingly clear that maturation proceeds through interconnected regulatory circuits that feed into one another to coordinate concomitant structural, functional and metabolic CM maturation. We highlight PGC1α, SRF and the MEF2 family as transcription factors that may potentially mediate this cross‐talk. We lastly discuss several emerging technologies that will facilitate future studies into the mechanisms of CM maturation. Further study will not only produce a better understanding of its key processes, but provide practical insights into developing a robust strategy to produce mature PSC‐CMs. Here, we postulate that there is a critical window, ranging from embryonic day 18.5 to postnatal day 14 in mice, in which interconnected regulatory circuits enable coordinated, concomitant structural, functional and metabolic cardiomyocyte maturation.}},

abstract = {{The C. elegans germline recapitulates mammalian stem cell niches and provides an effective platform for investigating key aspects of stem cell biology. However, the molecular and physiological requirements for germline stem cell homeostasis remain largely elusive. Here, we report that mitochondrial biogenesis and function are crucial for germline stem cell identity. We show that general transcription activity in germline mitochondria is highly compartmentalized, and determines mitochondrial maturation. RPOM-1, the mitochondrial RNA polymerase, is differentially expressed as germ nuclei progress from the distal to the proximal gonad arm to form oocytes. Mitochondria undergo changes from globular to tubular morphology and become polarized, as they approach the proximal gonad arm. Notably, this mitochondrial maturation trajectory is evolutionarily conserved. We find that a similar transition and temporal mitochondrial RNA polymerase expression profile characterizes differentiation of mammalian stem cells. In C. elegans, ATP, and ROS production increases sharply during maturation. Impaired mitochondrial bioenergetics causes gonad syncytium tumor formation by disrupting the balance between mitosis and differentiation to oocytes, which results in a marked reduction of fecundity. Consequently, compensatory apoptosis is induced in the germline. Sperm-derived signals promote mitochondrial maturation and proper germ cell differentiation via the MEK/ERK kinase pathway. Germ cell fate decisions are determined by a crosstalk between Insulin/IGF-1 and TGF-β signaling, mitochondria and protein synthesis. Our findings demonstrate that mitochondrial transcription activity determines a shift in mitochondrial bioenergetics, which in turn regulates germline stem cell survival and differentiation. Perturbation of mitochondrial transcription hinders proper germ cell differentiation and causes germline tumor development.}},

Mitochondrial dysfunction is widely implicated in ageing and in the diseases of ageing, through dysfunction in adenosine triphosphate (ATP) synthesis, Ca2+ homeostasis, central metabolic pathways or radical production. Nonetheless, the mechanisms and regulation of superoxide and hydrogen peroxide formation by mitochondria remain poorly described. Measurement of the capacities of different sites of superoxide and hydrogen peroxide production in isolated skeletal muscle mitochondria show that the maximum capacities of sites in complexes I, II and III and in several associated redox enzymes greatly exceed the native rates observed in the absence of respiratory chain inhibitors. In vitro, the native rates and the relative importance of different sites both depend on the substrate being oxidized, with sites IQ, IIF, GPDH, IF and IIIQo each being important with particular substrates. The techniques involved in measuring rates from each site should become applicable to cell cultures and in vivo in the future.}},

abstract = {{Pioneering biochemical studies have long forged the concept that the mitochondria are the ‘energy powerhouse of the cell’. These studies, combined with the unique evolutionary origin of the mitochondria, led the way to decades of research focusing on the organelle as an essential, yet independent, functional component of the cell. Recently, however, our conceptual view of this isolated organelle has been profoundly altered with the discovery that mitochondria function within an integrated reticulum that is continually remodeled by both fusion and fission events. The identification of a number of proteins that regulate these activities is beginning to provide mechanistic details of mitochondrial membrane remodeling. However, the broader question remains regarding the underlying purpose of mitochondrial dynamics and the translation of these morphological transitions into altered functional output. One hypothesis has been that mitochondrial respiration and metabolism may be spatially and temporally regulated by the architecture and positioning of the organelle. Recent evidence supports and expands this idea by demonstrating that mitochondria are an integral part of multiple cell signaling cascades. Interestingly, proteins such as GTPases, kinases and phosphatases are involved in bi-directional communication between the mitochondrial reticulum and the rest of the cell. These proteins link mitochondrial function and dynamics to the regulation of metabolism, cell-cycle control, development, antiviral responses and cell death. In this review we will highlight the emerging evidence that provides molecular definition to mitochondria as a central platform in the execution of diverse cellular events.}},

This study aimed to investigate the tunneling nanotube mechanisms that might be involved in stem cell-mediated mitochondrial rescue of injured vascular endothelial cells. Using laser scanning confocal microscopy, mitochondrial transfer via a tunneling nanotube-like structure was detected between mesenchymal stem cells and human umbilical vein endothelial cells. Oxygen glucose deprivation and reoxygenation were performed on human umbilical vein endothelial cells, which induced mitochondrial transfer through tunneling nanotube-like structures to become frequent and almost unidirectional from mesenchymal stem cells to injured endothelial cells, thereby resulting in the rescue of aerobic respiration and protection of endothelial cells from apoptosis. We found that the formation of tunneling nanotube-like structures might represent a defense and rescue mechanism through phosphatidylserines exposed on the surface of apoptotic endothelial cells and stem cell recognition.

We designed a protocol (MitoCeption) to directly and quantitatively transfer mitochondria, isolated from cell type A, to recipient cell type B. We validated and quantified the effective mitochondria transfer by imaging, fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) and mitochondrial DNA analysis. We show that the transfer of minute amounts of mesenchymal stem/stromal cell (MSC) mitochondria to cancer cells, a process otherwise occurring naturally in coculture, results in cancer cell enhanced oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) activity and favors cancer cell proliferation and invasion. The MitoCeption technique, which can be applied to different cell systems, will therefore be a method of choice to analyze the metabolic modifications induced by exogenous mitochondria in host cells.}},

abstract = {{About 8 \% of the human genome consists of human endogenous retroviruses (HERVs), which are relicts of ancient exogenous retroviral infections incurred during evolution. Although the majority of HERVs have functional gene defects or epigenetic modifications, many of them are still able to produce retroviral proteins that have been proposed to be involved in cellular transformation and cancer development. We found that, in chemo-resistant U87RETO glioblastoma cells, cytotoxic stress induced by etoposide promotes accumulation and large-scale fission of mitochondria, associated with the detection of HERV-WE1 (syncytin-1) and HERV-FRD1 (syncytin-2) in these organelles. In addition, mitochondrial preparations also contained the corresponding receptors, i.e. ASCT2 and MFSD2. We clearly demonstrated that mitochondria associated with HERV-proteins were shuttled between adjacent cancer cells not only via tunneling tubes, but also by direct cellular uptake across the cell membrane. Furthermore, anti-syncytin-1 and anti-syncytin-2 antibodies were able to specifically block this direct cellular uptake of mitochondria even more than antibodies targeting the cognate receptors. Here, we suggest that the association of mitochondria with syncytin-1/syncytin-2 together with their respective receptors could represent a novel mechanism of cell-to-cell transfer. In chemotherapy-refractory cancer cells, this might open up attractive avenues to novel mitochondria-targeting therapies.}},

Jahar Bhattacharya and colleagues now show that one way these cells offer such protection is to transfer their mitochondria to the injured lung epithelia to improve the bioenergetics of the recipient cells, thus probably allowing them to recover from injury more efficiently. Bone marrow–derived stromal cells (BMSCs) protect against acute lung injury (ALI). To determine the role of BMSC mitochondria in this protection, we airway-instilled mice first with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and then with either mouse BMSCs (mBMSCs) or human BMSCs (hBMSCs). Live optical studies revealed that the mBMSCs formed connexin 43 (Cx43)-containing gap junctional channels (GJCs) with the alveolar epithelia in these mice, releasing mitochondria-containing microvesicles that the epithelia engulfed. The presence of BMSC-derived mitochondria in the epithelia was evident optically, as well as by the presence of human mitochondrial DNA in mouse lungs instilled with hBMSCs. The mitochondrial transfer resulted in increased alveolar ATP concentrations. LPS-induced ALI, as indicated by alveolar leukocytosis and protein leak, inhibition of surfactant secretion and high mortality, was markedly abrogated by the instillation of wild-type mBMSCs but not of mutant, GJC-incompetent mBMSCs or mBMSCs with dysfunctional mitochondria. This is the first evidence, to our knowledge, that BMSCs protect against ALI by restituting alveolar bioenergetics through Cx43-dependent alveolar attachment and mitochondrial transfer.}},

abstract = {{Endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) have been pursued as a potential cellular therapy for stroke and central nervous system injury. However, their underlying mechanisms remain to be fully defined. Recent experimental studies suggest that mitochondria may be released and transferred between cells. In this proof‐of‐concept study, we asked whether beneficial effects of EPCs may partly involve a mitochondrial phenomenon as well. First, EPC‐derived conditioned medium was collected and divided into supernatant and particle fractions after centrifugation. Electron microscopy, Western blots, and flow cytometry showed that EPCs were able to release mitochondria. ATP and oxygen consumption assays suggested that these extracellular mitochondria may still be functionally viable. Confocal microscopy confirmed that EPC‐derived extracellular mitochondria can be incorporated into normal brain endothelial cells. Adding EPC particles to brain endothelial cells promoted angiogenesis and decreased the permeability of brain endothelial cells. Next, we asked whether EPC‐derived mitochondria may be protective. As expected, oxygen–glucose deprivation (OGD) increased brain endothelial permeability. Adding EPC‐derived mitochondria particles to the damaged brain endothelium increased levels of mitochondrial protein TOM40, mitochondrial DNA copy number, and intracellular ATP. Along with these indirect markers of mitochondrial transfer, endothelial tightness was also restored after OGD. Taken together, these findings suggest that EPCs may support brain endothelial energetics, barrier integrity, and angiogenic function partly through extracellular mitochondrial transfer.

Although their existence and functions in animal organisms are still elusive, emerging evidence suggests that they are involved in developmental processes, tissue regeneration, viral infections or pathogen transfer, stem cell differentiation, immune responses as well as initiation and progression of neurodegenerative disorders and cancer (see Sisakhtnezhad \& Khosravi 2015 Eur. J. Cell Biol. 94, 429–443. (doi:10.1016/j.ejcb.2015.06.010)). A broader field of vision, including their striking functional and structural resemblance with nanotube-mediated phenomena found throughout the phylogenetic tree, from plants down to bacteria, points to a universal, conserved and tightly regulated mechanism of cellular assemblies. Based on our initial definition of TNTs as open-ended channels mediating membrane continuity between connected cells (Rustom et al. 2004 Science 303, 1007–1010. (doi:10.1126/science.1093133)), it is suggested that animal tissues represent supercellular assemblies that—besides opening discrete communication pathways—balance diverse stress factors caused by pathological changes or fluctuating physiological and environmental conditions, such as oxidative stress or nutrient shortage. By combining current knowledge about nanotube formation, intercellular transfer and communication phenomena as well as associated molecular pathways, a model evolves, predicting that the linkage between reactive oxygen species, TNT-based supercellularity and the intercellular shuttling of materials will have significant impact on diverse body functions, such as cell survival, redox/metabolic homeostasis and mitochondrial heteroplasmy. It implies that TNTs are intimately linked to the physiological and pathological state of animal cells and represent a central joint element of diverse diseases, such as neurodegenerative disorders, diabetes or cancer.}},

Methods Homogenesis of mitochondria (wild-type mitochondria) isolated from normal donor cells with about 83.5\% preserved activity were delivered into MERRF fibroblasts by Pep-1 conjugation (Pep-1-Mito). Results Delivered doses of 52.5 μg and 105 μg Pep-1-Mito had better delivered efficiency and mitochondrial biogenesis after 15 days of treatment. The recovery of mitochondrial function in deficient cells receiving 3 days of treatment with peptide-mediated mitochondrial delivery was comprehensively demonstrated by restoration of oxidative phosphorylation subunits (complex I, III and IV), mitochondrial membrane potential, adenosine triphosphate synthesis and reduction of reactive oxygen species production. The benefits of enhanced mitochondrial regulation depended on the function of foreign mitochondria and not the existence of mitochondrial DNA and can be maintained for at least 21 days with dramatically elongated mitochondrial morphology. In contrast to delivery of wild-type mitochondria, the specific regulation of Pep-1-Mito during MERRF syndrome progression in cells treated with mutant mitochondria was reflected by the opposite performance, with increase in reactive oxygen species production and matrix metalloproteinase activity.

Here we demonstrate that mitochondria can be transformed into recipient cells very quickly, and co-localize with endogenous mitochondria. The isolated mitochondria interact directly with cells, which engulf the mitochondria with cellular extensions in a way, which may suggest the involvement of macropinocytosis or macropinocytosis-like mechanisms in mitochondrial transformation. Indeed, macropinocytosis inhibitors but not clathrin-mediated endocytosis inhibition-treatments, blocks mitochondria transformation. The integrity of the mitochondrial outer membrane and its proteins is essential for the transformation of the mitochondria into cells; cells can distinguish mitochondria from similar particles and transform only intact mitochondria. Mitochondrial transformation is blocked in the presence of the heparan sulfate molecules pentosan polysulfate and heparin, which indicate crucial involvement of cellular heparan sulfate proteoglycans in the mitochondrial transformation process.}},

PINK1 is constitutively degraded by an unknown mechanism and stabilized selectively on damaged mitochondria where it can recruit the E3 ligase PARK2/PARKIN to induce mitophagy. Here, we show that, under steady-state conditions, endogenous PINK1 is constitutively and rapidly degraded by E3 ubiquitin ligases UBR1, UBR2 and UBR4 through the N-end rule pathway. Following precursor import into mitochondria, PINK1 is cleaved in the transmembrane segment by a mitochondrial intramembrane protease PARL generating an N-terminal destabilizing amino acid and then retrotranslocates from mitochondria to the cytosol for N-end recognition and proteasomal degradation. Thus, sequential actions of mitochondrial import, PARL-processing, retrotranslocation and recognition by N-end rule E3 enzymes for the ubiquitin proteosomal degradation defines the rapid PINK1 turnover. PINK1 steady-state elimination by the N-end rule identifies a novel organelle to cytoplasm turnover pathway that yields a mechanism to flag damaged mitochondria for autophagic elimination.}},

Using mass spectrometry, we discovered that endogenous PINK1 phosphorylated ubiquitin at serine 65, homologous to the site phosphorylated by PINK1 in Parkin’s ubiquitin-like domain. Recombinant TcPINK1 directly phosphorylated ubiquitin and phospho-ubiquitin activated Parkin E3 ubiquitin ligase activity in cell-free assays.

abstract = {{Ubiquitin, known for its role in post-translational modification of other proteins, undergoes post-translational modification itself; after a decrease in mitochondrial membrane potential, the kinase enzyme PINK1 phosphorylates ubiquitin at Ser 65, and the phosphorylated ubiquitin then interacts with ubiquitin ligase (E3) enzyme parkin, which is also phosphorylated by PINK1, and this process is sufficient for full activation of parkin enzymatic activity. The small protein ubiquitin, familiar for its role in post-translational modification of other proteins by binding to them and regulating their activity or stability, is shown here to be the substrate of the kinase PINK1, which together with the ubiquitin ligase parkin is a causal gene for hereditary recessive Parkinsonism. Noriyuki Matsuda and colleagues show that following a decrease in mitochondrial membrane potential, PINK1 phosphorylates ubiquitin at serine residue 65; the phosphorylated ubiquitin then interacts with parkin, which is also phosphorylated by PINK1. This interaction allows full activation of parkin enzymatic activity, which involves tagging mitochondrial substrates with ubiquitin. PINK1 (PTEN induced putative kinase 1) and PARKIN (also known as PARK2) have been identified as the causal genes responsible for hereditary recessive early-onset Parkinsonism1,2. PINK1 is a Ser/Thr kinase that specifically accumulates on depolarized mitochondria, whereas parkin is an E3 ubiquitin ligase that catalyses ubiquitin transfer to mitochondrial substrates3,4,5. PINK1 acts as an upstream factor for parkin6,7 and is essential both for the activation of latent E3 parkin activity8 and for recruiting parkin onto depolarized mitochondria8,9,10,11,12. Recently, mechanistic insights into mitochondrial quality control mediated by PINK1 and parkin have been revealed3,4,5, and PINK1-dependent phosphorylation of parkin has been reported13,14,15. However, the requirement of PINK1 for parkin activation was not bypassed by phosphomimetic parkin mutation15, and how PINK1 accelerates the E3 activity of parkin on damaged mitochondria is still obscure. Here we report that ubiquitin is the genuine substrate of PINK1. PINK1 phosphorylated ubiquitin at Ser 65 both in vitro and in cells, and a Ser 65 phosphopeptide derived from endogenous ubiquitin was only detected in cells in the presence of PINK1 and following a decrease in mitochondrial membrane potential. Unexpectedly, phosphomimetic ubiquitin bypassed PINK1-dependent activation of a phosphomimetic parkin mutant in cells. Furthermore, phosphomimetic ubiquitin accelerates discharge of the thioester conjugate formed by UBCH7 (also known as UBE2L3) and ubiquitin (UBCH7∼ubiquitin) in the presence of parkin in vitro, indicating that it acts allosterically. The phosphorylation-dependent interaction between ubiquitin and parkin suggests that phosphorylated ubiquitin unlocks autoinhibition of the catalytic cysteine. Our results show that PINK1-dependent phosphorylation of both parkin and ubiquitin is sufficient for full activation of parkin E3 activity. These findings demonstrate that phosphorylated ubiquitin is a parkin activator.}},

abstract = {{We have previously reported that the Parkinson's disease-associated kinase PINK1 (PTEN-induced putative kinase 1) is activated by mitochondrial depolarization and stimulates the Parkin E3 ligase by phosphorylating Ser65 within its Ubl (ubiquitin-like) domain. Using phosphoproteomic analysis, we identified a novel ubiquitin phosphopeptide phosphorylated at Ser65 that was enriched 14-fold in HEK (human embryonic kidney)-293 cells overexpressing wild-type PINK1 stimulated with the mitochondrial uncoupling agent CCCP (carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone), to activate PINK1, compared with cells expressing kinase-inactive PINK1. Ser65 in ubiquitin lies in a similar motif to Ser65 in the Ubl domain of Parkin. Remarkably, PINK1 directly phosphorylates Ser65 of ubiquitin in vitro. We undertook a series of experiments that provide striking evidence that Ser65-phosphorylated ubiquitin (ubiquitinPhospho−Ser65) functions as a critical activator of Parkin. First, we demonstrate that a fragment of Parkin lacking the Ubl domain encompassing Ser65 (ΔUbl-Parkin) is robustly activated by ubiquitinPhospho−Ser65, but not by non-phosphorylated ubiquitin. Secondly, we find that the isolated Parkin Ubl domain phosphorylated at Ser65 (UblPhospho−Ser65) can also activate ΔUbl-Parkin similarly to ubiquitinPhospho−Ser65. Thirdly, we establish that ubiquitinPhospho−Ser65, but not non-phosphorylated ubiquitin or UblPhospho−Ser65, activates full-length wild-type Parkin as well as the non-phosphorylatable S65A Parkin mutant. Fourthly, we provide evidence that optimal activation of full-length Parkin E3 ligase is dependent on PINK1-mediated phosphorylation of both Parkin at Ser65 and ubiquitin at Ser65, since only mutation of both proteins at Ser65 completely abolishes Parkin activation. In conclusion, the findings of the present study reveal that PINK1 controls Parkin E3 ligase activity not only by phosphorylating Parkin at Ser65, but also by phosphorylating ubiquitin at Ser65. We propose that phosphorylation of Parkin at Ser65 serves to prime the E3 ligase enzyme for activation by ubiquitinPhospho−Ser65, suggesting that small molecules that mimic ubiquitinPhospho−Ser65 could hold promise as novel therapies for Parkinson's disease.}},

How these metabolic features are established remains unclear. Here we identified inherited metabolism imposed by functionally distinct mitochondrial age-classes as a fate determinant in asymmetric division of epithelial stem-like cells. While chronologically old mitochondria support oxidative respiration, the electron transport chain of new organelles is proteomically immature and they respire less. After cell division, selectively segregated mitochondrial age-classes elicit a metabolic bias in progeny cells, with oxidative energy metabolism promoting differentiation in cells that inherit old mitochondria. Cells that inherit newly synthesized mitochondria with low levels of Rieske iron–sulfur polypeptide 1 have a higher pentose phosphate pathway activity, which promotes de novo purine biosynthesis and redox balance, and is required to maintain stemness during early fate determination after division. Our results demonstrate that fate decisions are susceptible to intrinsic metabolic bias imposed by selectively inherited mitochondria. Döhla et al. show that selectively and asymmetrically inherited mitochondria impose a metabolic bias on progeny in mammary stem-like cells that alters the balance between stem cell self-renewal and differentiation.}},

Hence, proper mitochondrial function requires synchronization of gene expression in the nucleus and in mitochondria and necessitates efficient import of mitochondrial proteins into the organelle from the cytosol. Furthermore, the mitochondrial proteome displays high plasticity to allow the adaptation of mitochondrial function to cellular requirements. Maintenance of this complex and adaptable mitochondrial proteome is challenging, but is of crucial importance to cell function. Defects in mitochondrial proteostasis lead to proteotoxic insults and eventually cell death. Different quality control systems monitor the mitochondrial proteome. The cytosolic ubiquitin–proteasome system controls protein transport across the mitochondrial outer membrane and removes damaged or mislocalized proteins. Concomitantly, a number of mitochondrial chaperones and proteases govern protein folding and degrade damaged proteins inside mitochondria. The quality control factors also regulate processing and turnover of native proteins to control protein import, mitochondrial metabolism, signalling cascades, mitochondrial dynamics and lipid biogenesis, further ensuring proper function of mitochondria. Thus, mitochondrial protein quality control mechanisms are of pivotal importance to integrate mitochondria into the cellular environment. The mitochondrial proteome comprises \textbackslashtextasciitilde1,000–1,500 nuclear-encoded and mitochondrial-encoded proteins. To ensure proper mitochondrial function, cells use multiple mechanisms of quality control that survey mitochondrial protein biogenesis, import and folding, and allow mitochondria to adapt to the changing needs as well as to respond to stresses that compromise proteostasis.}},

We demonstrate that ectopic placement of NDP52 on mitochondria or peroxisomes is sufficient to initiate selective autophagy by focally localizing and activating the ULK1 complex. The capability of NDP52 to induce mitophagy is dependent on its interaction with the FIP200/ULK1 complex, which is facilitated by TBK1. Ectopically tethering ULK1 to cargo bypasses the requirement for autophagy receptors and TBK1. Focal activation of ULK1 occurs independently of AMPK and mTOR. Our findings provide a parsimonious model of selective autophagy, which highlights the coordination of ULK1 complex localization by autophagy receptors and TBK1 as principal drivers of targeted autophagosome biogenesis.}},

Analysis of cancer cell lines, mouse xenografts and patient-derived tumor samples all showed an association between mitochondrial metabolism and proteasome inhibitor sensitivity. When cells were forced to use oxidative phosphorylation rather than glycolysis, they became proteasome-inhibitor resistant. This mitochondrial state, however, creates a unique vulnerability: sensitivity to the small molecule compound elesclomol. Genome-wide CRISPR–Cas9 screening showed that a single gene, encoding the mitochondrial reductase FDX1, could rescue elesclomol-induced cell death. Enzymatic function and nuclear-magnetic-resonance-based analyses further showed that FDX1 is the direct target of elesclomol, which promotes a unique form of copper-dependent cell death. These studies explain a fundamental mechanism by which cells adapt to proteotoxic stress and suggest strategies to mitigate proteasome inhibitor resistance. Mitochondrial energy metabolism regulates proteotoxic stress tolerance, exposing a newly discovered sensitivity to the small molecule elesclomol, which induces FDX1-mediated, copper-dependent cell death.}},

Results from our studies reveal that combined treatment of the ferroptotic agent erastin and the apoptotic agent TRAIL effectively disrupted mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm) and subsequently promoted caspase activation. The alterations of mitochondrial membrane potential are probably due to an increase in oligomerization of BAX and its accumulation at the mitochondria during treatment with erastin and TRAIL. Interestingly, the combined treatment-promoted apoptosis was effectively inhibited in BAX-deficient HCT116 cells, but not BAK-deficient cells. These results indicate that the BAX-associated mitochondria-dependent pathway plays a pivotal role in erastin-enhanced TRAIL-induced apoptosis.}},

Numerous studies further demonstrate that cell type‐specific differences exist in mitochondria, with cells of a given lineage tailoring their endogenous mitochondrial population to suit specific functional needs. These findings, coupled with studies of the therapeutic potential of mitochondrial transplantation, provide a strong impetus to better understand how mitochondria can influence cell function or fate. Here an inducible mitochondrial depletion modelis used to study how cells lacking endogenous mitochondria respond, on a global protein expression level, to transplantation with lineage‐mismatched (LM) mitochondria. It is shown that LM mitochondrial transplantation does not alter the proteomic profile in nonmitochondria–depleted recipient cells; however, enforced depletion of endogenous mitochondria results in dramatic changes in the proteomic landscape, which returns to the predepletion state following internalization of LM mitochondria. These data, derived from a cell system that can be rendered free of influence by endogenous mitochondria, indicate that transplantation of mitochondria—even from a source that differs significantly from the recipient cell population, effectively restores a normal proteomic landscape to cells lacking their own mitochondria. Using a novel doxycycline (DOX) inducible yellow fluorescent protein‐Parkin expression plasmid, cells undergo enforced mitophagy leading to complete mitochondrial depletion. Subsequently, Parkin levels return to normal. This model allows us to perform lineage mismatched complete mitochondrial transplants on depleted cells.

Mitochondria are not only a source of ATP energy but also generators of reactive oxygen species (ROS), that cause oxidative damage, but also regulate physiological processes such as the switch from hyperplastic to hypertrophic growth after birth. As excess ROS production and oxidative damage are associated with cardiac pathology, it is not surprising that much of the research focused on the deleterious aspects of free radicals. However, cardiomyocytes are naturally highly adapted against repeating oxidative insults, with evidence suggesting that moderate and acute ROS exposure has beneficial consequences for mitochondrial maintenance and cardiac health. Antioxidant defenses, mitochondrial quality control, mtDNA maintenance mechanisms as well as mitochondrial fusion and fission improve mitochondrial function and cardiomyocyte survival under stress conditions. As these adaptive processes can be induced, promoting mitohormesis or mitochondrial biogenesis using controlled ROS exposure could provide a promising strategy to increase cardiomyocyte survival and prevent pathological remodeling of the myocardium.}},

abstract = {{Regeneration of the heart muscle after myocardial infarction with cardiomyocytes derived from human embryonic stem cells is demonstrated in non-human primates, with the grafts showing evidence of electromechanical coupling, although they were also associated with non-fatal arrhythmias. Human pluripotent stem cells have proven cardiomyocyte-generating abilities and have been extensively investigated for repair of the injured heart. There is still a long way to go before cardiac regenerative medicine can become a reality, however. In this study Charles Murry and colleagues examine the ability of exogenously delivered human embryonic-stem-cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hESC-CMs) to engraft to the host myocardium in a non-human primate model of myocardial infarction. They demonstrate large-scale heart remuscularization, electromechanical coupling of the graft to the host heart, and vascularization of the graft from host vessels. The grafts showed evidence of electromechanical coupling, but non-fatal arrhythmias were also observed in hESC-CM-engrafted primates. Pluripotent stem cells provide a potential solution to current epidemic rates of heart failure1 by providing human cardiomyocytes to support heart regeneration2. Studies of human embryonic-stem-cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hESC-CMs) in small-animal models have shown favourable effects of this treatment3,4,5,6,7. However, it remains unknown whether clinical-scale hESC-CM transplantation is feasible, safe or can provide sufficient myocardial regeneration. Here we show that hESC-CMs can be produced at a clinical scale (more than one billion cells per batch) and cryopreserved with good viability. Using a non-human primate model of myocardial ischaemia followed by reperfusion, we show that cryopreservation and intra-myocardial delivery of one billion hESC-CMs generates extensive remuscularization of the infarcted heart. The hESC-CMs showed progressive but incomplete maturation over a 3-month period. Grafts were perfused by host vasculature, and electromechanical junctions between graft and host myocytes were present within 2 weeks of engraftment. Importantly, grafts showed regular calcium transients that were synchronized to the host electrocardiogram, indicating electromechanical coupling. In contrast to small-animal models7, non-fatal ventricular arrhythmias were observed in hESC-CM-engrafted primates. Thus, hESC-CMs can remuscularize substantial amounts of the infarcted monkey heart. Comparable remuscularization of a human heart should be possible, but potential arrhythmic complications need to be overcome.}},

One month after hESC-CM transplantation, global left ventricular ejection fraction improved 10.6 ± 0.9\% vs. 2.5 ± 0.8\% in controls, and by 3 months there was an additional 12.4\% improvement in treated vs. a 3.5\% decline in controls.

This structural organization is designed to provide energy in the form of ATP to fuel normal pump function of the heart.

This process involves the action of a transcriptional regulatory network that builds and maintains the mitochondrial genome and drives the expression of the energy transduction machinery. This finely tuned system is responsive to developmental and physiological cues, as well as changes in fuel substrate availability. Deficiency of components critical for mitochondrial energy production frequently manifests as a cardiomyopathic phenotype, underscoring the requirement to maintain high respiration rates in the heart. Although a precise causative role is not clear, there is increasing evidence that perturbations in this regulatory system occur in the hypertrophied and failing heart.

However, the energy metabolic changes that occur in heart failure are complex and are dependent not only on the severity and type of heart failure present but also on the co-existence of common comorbidities such as obesity and type 2 diabetes. The failing heart faces an energy deficit, primarily because of a decrease in mitochondrial oxidative capacity. This is partly compensated for by an increase in ATP production from glycolysis. The relative contribution of the different fuels for mitochondrial ATP production also changes, including a decrease in glucose and amino acid oxidation, and an increase in ketone oxidation. The oxidation of fatty acids by the heart increases or decreases, depending on the type of heart failure. For instance, in heart failure associated with diabetes and obesity, myocardial fatty acid oxidation increases, while in heart failure associated with hypertension or ischemia, myocardial fatty acid oxidation decreases. Combined, these energy metabolic changes result in the failing heart becoming less efficient (ie, a decrease in cardiac work/O2 consumed). The alterations in both glycolysis and mitochondrial oxidative metabolism in the failing heart are due to both transcriptional changes in key enzymes involved in these metabolic pathways, as well as alterations in NAD redox state (NAD+ and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide levels) and metabolite signaling that contribute to posttranslational epigenetic changes in the control of expression of genes encoding energy metabolic enzymes. Alterations in the fate of glucose, beyond flux through glycolysis or glucose oxidation, also contribute to the pathology of heart failure. Of importance, pharmacological targeting of the energy metabolic pathways has emerged as a novel therapeutic approach to improving cardiac efficiency, decreasing the energy deficit and improving cardiac function in the failing heart.}},

Expression of the GTPase-domain mutant of Mfn2 (Mfn2(K109T)) in HeLa cells induced mitochondrial fragmentation in which Mfn2(K109T) localized at the restricted domains. Immuno-electronmicroscopy revealed that Mfn2(K109T) was concentrated at the contact domains between adjacent mitochondria, suggesting that fusion of the outer membrane was arrested at some intermediate step. Mfn1 expression induced highly connected tubular network structures depending on the functional GTPase domain. The Mfn1-induced tubular networks were suppressed by co-expression with Mfn2. In vivo depletion of either isoform by RNA interference revealed that both are required to maintain normal mitochondrial morphology. The fusion of differentially-labeled mitochondria in HeLa cells subjected to depletion of either Mfn isoform and subsequent cell fusion by hemagglutinating virus of Japan revealed that both proteins have distinct functions in mitochondrial fusion.

Inhibition of Drp1 by overexpression of a dominant-negative mutant counteracts the conversion to a punctiform mitochondrial phenotype, prevents the loss of the mitochondrial membrane potential and the release of cytochrome c, and reveals a reproducible swelling of the organelles. Remarkably, inhibition of Drp1 blocks cell death, implicating mitochondrial fission as an important step in apoptosis.}},

abstract = {{Hydrogenosomes are simple organelles found in anaerobic protists and fungi. They are double-membraned and produce ATP and hydrogen, hence suggestions that they are anaerobic derivatives of mitochondria. An alternative view suggests that mitochondria and hydrogenosomes arose from a common ancestor, a facultatively anaerobic bacterium. The discovery of a novel hydrogenosome in Nyctotherus ovalis, a ciliate that lives in the gut of cockroaches, further complicates this debate. It is unique among known hydrogenosomes because, just like a mitochondrion, it retains its own genome. This ‘missing link’ between hydrogenosomes and mitochondria also has remnants of an electron transport chain characteristic of an aerobic lifestyle. Hydrogenosomes are organelles that produce ATP and hydrogen1, and are found in various unrelated eukaryotes, such as anaerobic flagellates, chytridiomycete fungi and ciliates2. Although all of these organelles generate hydrogen, the hydrogenosomes from these organisms are structurally and metabolically quite different, just like mitochondria where large differences also exist3. These differences have led to a continuing debate about the evolutionary origin of hydrogenosomes4,5. Here we show that the hydrogenosomes of the anaerobic ciliate Nyctotherus ovalis, which thrives in the hindgut of cockroaches, have retained a rudimentary genome encoding components of a mitochondrial electron transport chain. Phylogenetic analyses reveal that those proteins cluster with their homologues from aerobic ciliates. In addition, several nucleus-encoded components of the mitochondrial proteome, such as pyruvate dehydrogenase and complex II, were identified. The N. ovalis hydrogenosome is sensitive to inhibitors of mitochondrial complex I and produces succinate as a major metabolic end product—biochemical traits typical of anaerobic mitochondria3. The production of hydrogen, together with the presence of a genome encoding respiratory chain components, and biochemical features characteristic of anaerobic mitochondria, identify the N. ovalis organelle as a missing link between mitochondria and hydrogenosomes.}},

abstract = {{Oxidative phosphorylation provides most of the ATP that higher animals and plants use to support life and is responsible for setting and maintaining metabolic homeostasis. The pathway incorporates three consecutive near equilibrium steps for moving reducing equivalents between the intramitochondrial [NAD+]/[NADH] pool to molecular oxygen, with irreversible reduction of oxygen to bound peroxide at cytochrome c oxidase determining the net flux. Net flux (oxygen consumption rate) is determined by demand for ATP, with feedback by the energy state ([ATP]/[ADP][Pi]) regulating the pathway. This feedback affects the reversible steps equally and independently, resulting in the rate being coupled to ([ATP]/[ADP][Pi])3. With increasing energy state, oxygen consumption decreases rapidly until a threshold is reached, above which there is little further decrease. In most cells, [ATP] and [Pi] are much higher than [ADP] and change in [ADP] is primarily responsible for the change in energy state. As a result, the rate of ATP synthesis, plotted against [ADP], remains low until [ADP] reaches about 30 μm and then increases rapidly with further increase in [ADP]. The dependencies on energy state and [ADP] near the threshold can be fitted by the Hill equation with a Hill coefficients of about −2.6 and 4.2, respectively. The homeostatic set point for metabolism is determined by the threshold, which can be modulated by the and intramitochondrial [NAD+]/[NADH]. The ability of oxidative phosphorylation to precisely set and maintain metabolic homeostasis is consistent with it being permissive of, and essential to, development of higher plants and animals. Integration of oxidative phosphorylation into cellular metabolism made possible the evolutionary development of higher organisms. Progressive improvements in control of oxidative phosphorylation supported the increasing demands of specialized tissues, in particular muscles and neurons. One of these improvements, replacing arginine kinase with creatine kinase, was permissive of the evolutionary development of vertebrates.}},

Mitochondria have become recognized not merely as being energy suppliers but also as having an essential role in the development of diseases associated with ageing, such as neurodegenerative and cardiovascular diseases. A growing body of evidence suggests that ageing and age-related diseases are tightly related to an energy supply and demand imbalance, which might be alleviated by a variety of interventions, including physical activity and calorie restriction, as well as naturally occurring molecules targeting conserved longevity pathways. Here, we review key historical advances and progress from the past few years in our understanding of the role of mitochondria in ageing and age-related metabolic diseases. We also highlight emerging scientific innovations using mitochondria-targeted therapeutic approaches. This Review discusses the role of mitochondria in metabolism and how mitochondria contribute to age-related metabolic diseases. This knowledge might guide us in designing therapies targeting metabolic disorders to extend human health span and lifespan. The rate of ageing is coordinated, at least in part, by conserved genetic and biochemical pathways.A complex network of interactions between longevity pathways reveals an intricate regulation of mitochondrial physiology during ageing.Cellular metabolism interconnects the nine hallmarks of ageing, and deregulation of energy metabolism by environmental variations is an essential process leading to mitochondrial dysfunction during ageing.A better understanding of mitochondrial dysfunction during ageing and age-related metabolic diseases will provide fundamental knowledge to develop therapies to combat late-life morbidities.Human longitudinal studies will be essential to understand individuals’ risk of diseases much earlier in life, and will inform health choices and medical care options.

Several underlying mechanisms of deregulated cellular energetics are associated with mitochondrial dysfunction caused by mitochondrial DNA mutations, mitochondrial enzyme defects, or altered oncogenes/tumor suppressors. In this review, we summarize the current understanding about the role of mitochondrial dysfunction in cancer progression. Point mutations and copy number changes are the two most common mitochondrial DNA alterations in cancers, and mitochondrial dysfunction induced by chemical depletion of mitochondrial DNA or impairment of mitochondrial respiratory chain in cancer cells promotes cancer progression to a chemoresistance or invasive phenotype. Moreover, defects in mitochondrial enzymes, such as succinate dehydrogenase, fumarate hydratase, and isocitrate dehydrogenase, are associated with both familial and sporadic forms of cancer. Deregulated mitochondrial deacetylase sirtuin 3 might modulate cancer progression by regulating cellular metabolism and oxidative stress. These mitochondrial defects during oncogenesis and tumor progression activate cytosolic signaling pathways that ultimately alter nuclear gene expression, a process called retrograde signaling. Changes in the intracellular level of reactive oxygen species, Ca2+, or oncometabolites are important in the mitochondrial retrograde signaling for neoplastic transformation and cancer progression. In addition, altered oncogenes/tumor suppressors including hypoxia-inducible factor 1 and tumor suppressor p53 regulate mitochondrial respiration and cellular metabolism by modulating the expression of their target genes. We thus suggest that mitochondrial dysfunction plays a critical role in cancer progression and that targeting mitochondrial alterations and mitochondrial retrograde signaling might be a promising strategy for the development of selective anticancer therapy.}},

Cells that underwent mitochondrial dysfunction-associated senescence (MiDAS) had lower NAD+/NADH ratios, which caused both the growth arrest and prevented the IL-1-associated SASP through AMPK-mediated p53 activation. Progeroid mice that rapidly accrue mtDNA mutations accumulated senescent cells with a MiDAS SASP in vivo, which suppressed adipogenesis and stimulated keratinocyte differentiation in cell culture.

In this work, various orthogonal multidimensional separation techniques both on the protein and on the peptide level are compared with regard to the number of identified proteins as well as the classes of proteins accessible by the respective methodology. The most complete overview was achieved by a combination of such orthogonal techniques as shown by the analysis of the yeast mitochondrial proteome. A total of 851 different proteins (PROMITO dataset) were identified by use of multidimensional LC−MS/MS, 1D-SDS-PAGE combined with nano-LC−MS/MS and 2D-PAGE with subsequent MALDI-mass fingerprinting. Our PROMITO approach identified the 749 proteins, which were found in the largest previous study on the yeast mitochondrial proteome, and additionally 102 proteins including 42 open reading frames with unknown function, providing the basis for a more detailed elucidation of mitochondrial processes. Comparison of the different approaches emphasizes a bias of 2D-PAGE against proteins with very high isoelectric points as well as large and hydrophobic proteins, which can be accessed more appropriately by the other methods. While 2D-PAGE has advantages in the possible separation of protein isoforms and quantitative differential profiling, 1D-SDS-PAGE with nano-LC−MS/MS and multidimensional LC−MS/MS are better suited for efficient protein identification as they are less biased against distinct classes of proteins. Thus, comprehensive proteome analyses can only be realized by a combination of such orthogonal approaches, leading to the largest dataset available for the mitochondrial proteome of yeast.

Across tissues, expression covariation between genes' proteins and transcripts—measured in the same individuals—broadly aligned. Covariation was however far stronger in certain subsets than others: only 8\% of transcripts in the lowest expression and variance quintile covaried with their protein, in contrast to 65\% of transcripts in the highest quintiles. Key functional differences among the 3648 genes were also observed across tissues, with electron transport chain (ETC) genes particularly investigated. ETC complex proteins covary and form strong gene networks according to tissue, but their equivalent transcripts do not. Certain physiological consequences, such as the depletion of ATP synthase in BAT, are thus obscured in transcript data. Lastly, we compared the quantitative proteomic measurements between the total cell and mitochondrial fractions for the five tissues. The resulting enrichment score highlighted several hundred proteins which were strongly enriched in mitochondria, which included several dozen proteins were not reported in literature to be mitochondrially localized. Four of these candidates were selected for biochemical validation, where we found MTAP, SOAT2, and IMPDH2 to be localized inside the mitochondria, whereas ABCC6 was in the mitochondria-associated membrane.

abstract = {{The aim of this study has been to observe, by electron microscopy, the morphological changes affecting mitochondria and associated organelles in the human female germ cell during oogenesis, maturation and fertilization. In the primordial germ cell (PGC), rounded mitochondria with a pale matrix and small vesicular cristae are disposed near the nucleus and significantly increase in number during PGC migration and settlement in the gonadal ridge, where they differentiate into oogonia. In these early stages of mammalian oogenesis, aggregates of mitochondria are typically clustered around or in close relationship with the nuage. In oocytes at early prophase stage, mitochondria proliferate while aligned along the outer surface of the nuclear membrane, contain a more dense matrix than before, and have lamellar cristae. Oocytes of primordial and primary follicles mostly contain round or irregular mitochondria whose matrix has become very light. These mitochondria show typical parallel, arched cristae, and are clustered near the nucleus with other organelles forming the Balbiani's vitelline body. When follicles grow, the mitochondria of the oocytes become even more numerous and are dispersed in the ooplasm. Both paranuclear accumulation and subsequent dispersion of mitochondria in the cytoplasm are likely to be regulated by microtubules. By ovulation, mitochondria are the most prominent organelles in the ooplasm. They form voluminous aggregates with smooth endoplasmic reticulum (SER) tubules and vesicles. These mitochondrial–SER aggregates (M–SER) and the mitochondrial–vesicle complexes (MV) could be involved in the production of a reservoir of substances or membranes anticipating subsequent fertilization and early embryogenesis. Just after fertilization, the mitochondria of the oocyte undergo a further substantial change in size, shape, and microtopography. In the pronuclear zygote, mitochondria concentrate around the pronuclei. During the first embryonic cleavage divisions, round or oval mitochondria with a dense matrix and few arched cristae are gradually replaced by elongated ones with a less dense matrix and numerous transverse cristae. A progressive reduction in size and number of M–SER aggregates and MV complexes also occurs. In summary, oocyte mitochondria show dynamic morphological changes as they increase in number and populate different cell domains within the oocyte. They form complex relationships with other cell organelles, according to the different energetic -metabolic needs of the cell during differentiation, maturation, and fertilization, and are ultimately inherited by the developing embryo, where they eventually assume a more typical somatic cell form.}},

The principal intracellular reductant is NADPH, which is mainly produced by the pentose phosphate pathway through the actions of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD), the rate-limiting enzyme of the pentose phosphate pathway, and by 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase. Previous research has suggested that an increase in G6PD activity is important for cell growth. In this article, we suggest that G6PD activity plays a critical role in cell growth by providing NADPH for redox regulation. The results show the following: 1) inhibition of G6PD activity abrogated growth factor stimulation of [3H]thymidine incorporation in all cell lines tested; 2) overexpression of G6PD stimulated cell growth, as measured by an increase in [3H]thymidine incorporations as compared with cells transfected with vector alone; 3) inhibition of G6PD caused cells to be more susceptible to the growth inhibitory effects of H2O2; 4) inhibition of G6PD led to a 30–40\% decrease in the NADPH/NADP ratio; and 5) inhibition of G6PD inhibited cell anchorage and significantly decreased the growth-related stimulation of tyrosine phosphorylation.}},

Manipulation of these metabolites' concentrations directly influences stem cell behavior, highlighting biological oxidation as a driver for differentiation. Metabolites offer an important unexplored complementary approach to understanding the pluripotency of stem cells. Using MS-based metabolomics, we show that embryonic stem cells are characterized by abundant metabolites with highly unsaturated structures whose levels decrease upon differentiation. By monitoring the reduced and oxidized glutathione ratio as well as ascorbic acid levels, we demonstrate that the stem cell redox status is regulated during differentiation. On the basis of the oxidative biochemistry of the unsaturated metabolites, we experimentally manipulated specific pathways in embryonic stem cells while monitoring the effects on differentiation. Inhibition of the eicosanoid signaling pathway promoted pluripotency and maintained levels of unsaturated fatty acids. In contrast, downstream oxidized metabolites (for example, neuroprotectin D1) and substrates of pro-oxidative reactions (for example, acyl-carnitines), promoted neuronal and cardiac differentiation. We postulate that the highly unsaturated metabolome sustained by stem cells allows them to differentiate in response to in vivo oxidative processes such as inflammation.}},

This early increase in mitochondrial metabolism and ROS generation was dependent on mTORC1 signaling. Mitochondrial-targeted antioxidants inhibited adipocyte differentiation, which was rescued by the addition of exogenous hydrogen peroxide. Genetic manipulation of mitochondrial complex III revealed that ROS generated from this complex is required to initiate adipocyte differentiation.

Ablation of TFAM in keratinocytes impaired epidermal differentiation and hair follicle growth and resulted in death 2 weeks after birth. TFAM-deficient keratinocytes failed to generate mitochondria-derived ROS, a deficiency that prevented the transmission of Notch and β-catenin signals essential for epidermal differentiation and hair follicle development, respectively. In vitro keratinocyte differentiation was inhibited in the presence of antioxidants, and the decreased differentiation marker abundance in TFAM-deficient keratinocytes was partly rescued by application of exogenous hydrogen peroxide.

In contrast, differentiated cells harbour a branched mitochondrial network with oxidative phosphorylation as the main energy source. A role for mitochondria in hPSC bioenergetics and in cell differentiation therefore remains uncertain. Here, we show that hPSCs have functional respiratory complexes that are able to consume O2 at maximal capacity. Despite this, ATP generation in hPSCs is mainly by glycolysis and ATP is consumed by the F1F0 ATP synthase to partially maintain hPSC mitochondrial membrane potential and cell viability. Uncoupling protein 2 (UCP2) plays a regulating role in hPSC energy metabolism by preventing mitochondrial glucose oxidation and facilitating glycolysis via a substrate shunting mechanism. With early differentiation, hPSC proliferation slows, energy metabolism decreases, and UCP2 is repressed, resulting in decreased glycolysis and maintained or increased mitochondrial glucose oxidation. Ectopic UCP2 expression perturbs this metabolic transition and impairs hPSC differentiation. Overall, hPSCs contain active mitochondria and require UCP2 repression for full differentiation potential. While studying metabolic fluxes in human pluripotent stem cells, this paper reveals UCP2 as metabolic switch from glycolysis to OXPHOS, facilitating early differentiation events.}},

The activation of dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1), as well as its mitochondrial translocation, play important roles in the changes of both mitochondrial morphology and mitochondrial functions after hypoxia. However, in addition to mediating mitochondrial fission, whether Drp1 has other regulatory roles in mitochondrial homeostasis after mitochondrial translocation is unknown. In this study, we performed a series of interaction and colocalization assays and found that, after mitochondrial translocation, Drp1 may promote the excessive opening of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP) after hypoxia. Firstly, mitochondrial Drp1 maximumly recognizes mPTP channels by binding Bcl-2-associated X protein (BAX) and a phosphate carrier protein (PiC) in the mPTP. Then, leucine-rich repeat serine/threonine-protein kinase 2 (LRRK2) is recruited, whose kinase activity is inhibited by direct binding with mitochondrial Drp1 after hypoxia. Subsequently, the mPTP-related protein hexokinase 2 (HK2) is inactivated at Thr-473 and dissociates from the mitochondrial membrane, ultimately causing structural disruption and overopening of mPTP, which aggravates mitochondrial and cellular dysfunction after hypoxia. Thus, our study interprets the dual direct regulation of mitochondrial Drp1 on mitochondrial morphology and functions after hypoxia and proposes a new mitochondrial fission-independent mechanism for the role of Drp1 after its translocation in hypoxic injury.}},

Herein, the American Cancer Society provides an overview of ovarian cancer occurrence based on incidence data from nationwide population‐based cancer registries and mortality data from the National Center for Health Statistics. The status of early detection strategies is also reviewed. In the United States, the overall ovarian cancer incidence rate declined from 1985 (16.6 per 100,000) to 2014 (11.8 per 100,000) by 29\% and the mortality rate declined between 1976 (10.0 per 100,000) and 2015 (6.7 per 100,000) by 33\%. Ovarian cancer encompasses a heterogenous group of malignancies that vary in etiology, molecular biology, and numerous other characteristics. Ninety percent of ovarian cancers are epithelial, the most common being serous carcinoma, for which incidence is highest in non‐Hispanic whites (NHWs) (5.2 per 100,000) and lowest in non‐Hispanic blacks (NHBs) and Asians/Pacific Islanders (APIs) (3.4 per 100,000). Notably, however, APIs have the highest incidence of endometrioid and clear cell carcinomas, which occur at younger ages and help explain comparable epithelial cancer incidence for APIs and NHWs younger than 55 years. Most serous carcinomas are diagnosed at stage III (51\%) or IV (29\%), for which the 5‐year cause‐specific survival for patients diagnosed during 2007 through 2013 was 42\% and 26\%, respectively. For all stages of epithelial cancer combined, 5‐year survival is highest in APIs (57\%) and lowest in NHBs (35\%), who have the lowest survival for almost every stage of diagnosis across cancer subtypes. Moreover, survival has plateaued in NHBs for decades despite increasing in NHWs, from 40\% for cases diagnosed during 1992 through 1994 to 47\% during 2007 through 2013. Progress in reducing ovarian cancer incidence and mortality can be accelerated by reducing racial disparities and furthering knowledge of etiology and tumorigenesis to facilitate strategies for prevention and early detection.

For most gynecologic cancers including ovarian, cervical, and placental, the list of available small molecule therapies is relatively small compared to options for other cancers. While overall cancer mortality rates have decreased in the United States as early diagnoses and cancer therapies have become more effective, ovarian cancer still has low survival rates due to the lack of effective treatment options, drug resistance, and late diagnosis. To understand chemotherapeutic diversity in gynecologic cancers, we have screened 7914 approved drugs and bioactive compounds in 11 gynecologic cancer cell lines to profile their chemotherapeutic sensitivity. We identified two HDAC inhibitors, mocetinostat and entinostat, as pan-gynecologic cancer suppressors with IC50 values within an order of magnitude of their human plasma concentrations. In addition, many active compounds identified, including the non-anticancer drugs and other compounds, diversely inhibited the growth of three gynecologic cancer cell groups and individual cancer cell lines. These newly identified compounds are valuable for further studies of new therapeutics development, synergistic drug combinations, and new target identification for gynecologic cancers. The results also provide a rationale for the personalized chemotherapeutic testing of anticancer drugs in treatment of gynecologic cancer.}},

abstract = {{Cisplatin is one of the most potent antitumor agents known, displaying clinical activity against a wide variety of solid tumors. Its cytotoxic mode of action is mediated by its interaction with DNA to form DNA adducts, primarily intrastrand crosslink adducts, which activate several signal transduction pathways, including those involving ATR, p53, p73, and MAPK, and culminate in the activation of apoptosis. DNA damage-mediated apoptotic signals, however, can be attenuated, and the resistance that ensues is a major limitation of cisplatin-based chemotherapy. The mechanisms responsible for cisplatin resistance are several, and contribute to the multifactorial nature of the problem. Resistance mechanisms that limit the extent of DNA damage include reduced drug uptake, increased drug inactivation, and increased DNA adduct repair. Origins of these pharmacologic-based mechanisms, however, are at the molecular level. Mechanisms that inhibit propagation of the DNA damage signal to the apoptotic machinery include loss of damage recognition, overexpression of HER-2/neu, activation of the PI3-K/Akt (also known as PI3-K/PKB) pathway, loss of p53 function, overexpression of antiapoptotic bcl-2, and interference in caspase activation. The molecular signature defining the resistant phenotype varies between tumors, and the number of resistance mechanisms activated in response to selection pressures dictates the overall extent of cisplatin resistance.}},

Although some platinum-sensitive tumours may be cured by combination chemotherapy (e.g. testicular cancer), most will relapse and subsequently prove resistant to platinum compounds. The mechanisms of platinum resistance in patients are still poorly understood. Clearly, when a tumour relapses a long time after successful first-line treatment, there is a high chance that it will still be sensitive to platinum compounds. A number of studies have attempted to assess the role of drug transport, the glutathione system, DNA repair and apoptosis genes in the development of resistance in tumours, but no conclusive evidence is available. Approaches to increasing the potency of platinum therapy (to overcome resistance) have been devised and some have proved to be effective; in particular, intraperitoneal administration of cisplatin has shown superiority over intravenous administration in selected patients with ovarian cancer. The development of drugs and techniques to reduce the adverse effects of platinum chemotherapy has greatly improved their administration. Investigations attempting to modulate platinum activity and toxicity have also been performed. Further investigation of in vivo resistance mechanisms should be valuable in allowing prediction of clinical response to chemotherapy and may identify new treatments with the potential to improve outcomes for patients with a variety of platinum-resistant tumour types.}},

Reconstitution of MCF-7 cells by stable transfection of CASP-3 cDNA restores all these defects and results in an extensive apoptosis after cisplatin treatment. We further show that in extracts from caspase-3-deficient MCF-7 cells, procaspase-9 processing is strongly impaired after stimulation with either cytochrome c or recombinant caspase-8. Reconstitution of MCF-7 cell extracts with procaspase-3 corrects this defect, resulting in an efficient and complete processing of procaspase-9.

Circumventing cisplatin resistance remains, therefore, a major goal for clinical therapy and represents a challenge for scientific research. Recent studies have brought to light the fundamental role of mitochondria in onset, progression, and metastasis of cancer, as well as its importance in the resistance to chemotherapy. The aim of this review is to give an overview of the current knowledge about the implication of mitochondria in cisplatin resistance and on the recent development in this research field. Recent studies have highlighted the role of mitochondrial DNA alterations in onset of resistance phenomena, being related both to redox balance alterations and to signal crosstalk with the nucleus, allowing a rewiring of cell metabolism. Moreover, an important role of the mitochondrial dynamics in the adaptation mechanism of cancer cells to challenging environment has been revealed. Giving bioenergetic plasticity to tumor cells, mitochondria allow cells to evade death pathways in stressful conditions, including chemotherapy. So far, even if the central role of mitochondria is recognized, little is known about the specific mechanisms implicated in the resistance. Nevertheless, mitochondria appear to be promising pharmacological targets for overcoming cisplatin resistance, but further studies are necessary.}},

Pathways to caspase-3 activation have been identified that are either dependent on or independent of mitochondrial cytochrome c release and caspase-9 function.

Caspase-3 is also required for some typical hallmarks of apoptosis, and is indispensable for apoptotic chromatin condensation and DNA fragmentation in all cell types examined.

Cisplatin binds to DNA and induces DNA-damage culminating in mitochondria-mediated apoptosis. Interestingly, mitochondrial DNA is critically affected by cisplatin but its relevance in cell death induction is scarcely investigated. We find that cisplatin sensitive HGSC cell lines contain higher mitochondrial content and higher levels of mitochondrial ROS (mtROS) than cells resistant to cisplatin induced cell death. In clonal sub-lines from OVCAR-3 mitochondrial content and basal oxygen consumption rate correlate with sensitivity to cisplatin induced apoptosis. Mitochondria are in two ways pivotal for cisplatin sensitivity because not only knock-down of BAX and BAK but also the ROS scavenger glutathione diminish cisplatin induced apoptosis. Mitochondrial ROS correlates with mitochondrial content and reduction of mitochondrial biogenesis by knock-down of transcription factors PGC1α or TFAM attenuates both mtROS induction and cisplatin induced apoptosis. Increasing mitochondrial ROS by inhibition or knock-down of the ROS-protective uncoupling protein UCP2 enhances cisplatin induced apoptosis. Similarly, enhancing ROS by high-dose ascorbic acid or H2O2 augments cisplatin induced apoptosis. In summary, mitochondrial content and the resulting mitochondrial capacity to produce ROS critically determine HGSC cell sensitivity to cisplatin induced apoptosis. In line with this observation, data from the human protein atlas (www.proteinatlas.org) indicates that high expression of mitochondrial marker proteins (TFAM and TIMM23) is a favorable prognostic factor in ovarian cancer patients. Thus, we propose mitochondrial content as a biomarker for the response to platinum-based therapies. Functionally, this might be exploited by increasing mitochondrial content or mitochondrial ROS production to enhance sensitivity to cisplatin based anti-cancer therapies.}},

The aim of the present study was to examine the effect of the non‐selective adenosine receptor inhibitor theophylline and the phosphodiesterase inhibitor pentoxifylline on CDDP‐induced renal and testicular toxicity. 2. Male Wister rats were divided into six groups. Two control groups received plain drinking water and a third control group received theophylline 0.8 mg/mL in the drinking water for 2 weeks. One group of animals drinking plain water was injected intraperitoneally (i.p.) with pentoxifylline 50 mg/kg per day for 2 weeks. The remaining groups were treated in the same manner and received single dose of CDDP 7 mg/kg, i.p., 1 week after starting theophylline and pentoxifylline treatment and all animals were killed 1 week after CDDP treatment. 3. Rats treated with CDDP developed nephrotoxicity, as demonstrated by increased kidney and testes weight as a percentage of total bodyweight, blood urea nitrogen and serum creatinine levels and decreased serum calcium and albumin levels. In addition, CDDP treatment resulted in an increase in the production of malondialdehyde (MDA) and decreases in total nitrate/nitrite levels, as well as depletion of reduced glutathione (GSH) content and glutathione peroxidase (GPX) activity in both the kidney and testes. Administration of theophylline in the drinking water to CDDP‐treated rats resulted in exacerbation of the indices of nephrotoxicity, depletion of GSH content and GPX activity levels, with increased MDA production and platinum accumulation in both the kidney and testes. However, pentoxifylline administration reduced CDDP‐induced biochemical changes and reduced platinum accumulation in both organs. Histopathological examination of the kidney revealed that CDDP treatment produced multifocal tubular atrophy, atypical reparative changes of the tubular epithelium and marked tubular necrosis. Animals treated with the theophylline/CDDP combination showed extensive widespread damage with intratubular calcification. However, pentoxifylline treatment ameliorated the overt changes induced by CDDP treatment. 4. Theophylline exacerbates the deleterious effects of CDDP on rat kidney and testes.

Gene ontology and pathway enrichment analyses further found that aberrant activation of EGFR/ErbB2 signaling was the driving event in resistant cells. A network of dysregulated genes was built based on these identified DEGs and protein-protein interaction network, which led to the identification of 7 potential inhibitors based on screening a 77 small molecule natural product library. Sanguinarine, alone and in combination with cisplatin, was found to significantly suppress the proliferation of wt/resistant ovarian cancer cells in vitro and the growth of parental and resistant ovarian xenograft tumors in vivo. Our study suggests that EGFR/ErbB2 activation is one of the driving pathways in developing cisplatin-resistance in ovarian cancer, and that sanguinarine has the potential to be developed as an effective therapy to overcome this therapeutic resistance.}},

Recent studies have documented that Nkx2-5-positive cells are not limited to the cardiac lineage, but can give rise to endothelial and smooth muscle lineages. Other work has elucidated that, in addition to promoting cardiac development, Nkx2-5 plays a larger role in mesodermal patterning although the transcriptional networks that govern this developmental patterning are undefined. By profiling early Nkx2-5-positive progenitor cells, we discovered that the progenitor pools of the bisected cardiac crescent are differentiating asynchronously. This asymmetry requires Nkx2-5 as it is lost in the Nkx2-5 mutant. Surprisingly, the posterior Hox genes Hoxa9 and Hoxa10 were expressed on the right side of the cardiac crescent, independently of Nkx2-5. We describe a novel, transient, and asymmetric cardiac-specific expression pattern of the posterior Hox genes, Hoxa9 and Hoxa10, and utilize the embryonic stem cell/embryoid body (ES/EB) model system to illustrate that Hoxa10 impairs cardiac differentiation. We suggest a model whereby Hoxa10 cooperates with Nkx2-5 to regulate the timing of cardiac mesoderm differentiation.}},

abstract = {{The objective of this study was to investigate the presence of Thy-1 in the myocardium and on cardiac fibroblasts and to determine whether or not cardiac fibroblasts form a heterogeneous population in term of Thy-1 expression. Thy-1 expression was examined by immunohistology of ventricular sections from normal and deoxycorticosterone acetate (DOCA)-salt hypertensive rats. Thy-1 immunostaining was detected in connective tissue on α8 integrin-positive and discoidin domain receptor 2 (DDR2)-positive fibroblasts. Enhanced Thy-1 staining was observed in the hearts of DOCA-salt rats particularly in areas of interstitial fibrosis. Cardiac mRNA analysis confirmed the increased Thy-1 expression. On cultured cardiac fibroblasts, flow cytofluorometry showed that cells, from primary culture to passage 4, were double positive for Thy-1 and for both α8 integrin and DDR2. Analysis of isolated lipid rafts by detergent-free sucrose gradient indicated that Thy-1 protein was probably located in these structures, but it may be located on a membrane microdomain slightly different from those of caveolin-1, as revealed by immunocytochemistry. Differentiation of fibroblasts into myofibroblasts being a characteristic of cardiac fibrosis and scarring, cardiac fibroblasts were stimulated in the presence of transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β) or connective tissue growth factor. While the expression of smooth muscle α-actin and α8 integrin doubled, Thy-1 level, measured by Western blotting and flow cytofluorometry, was not influenced by TGF-β. These results demonstrate that cardiac fibroblasts express Thy-1 and form a homogeneous population. Thy-1 expression also appears to be independent of fibroblast differentiation. The dichotomy between the increased Tthy-1 expression in the fibrotic area and the lack of association with fibroblast differentiation suggests that Thy-1 may represent a marker of fibroblast proliferation in the myocardium.}},

More recently, studies in bacteria and yeast have demonstrated important roles for ferredoxin and ferredoxin reductase in iron–sulfur cluster assembly. The human genome contains two homologous ferredoxins, ferredoxin 1 (FDX1) and ferredoxin 2 (FDX2 — formerly known as ferredoxin 1L). More recently, the roles of these two human ferredoxins in iron–sulfur cluster assembly were assessed, and it was concluded that FDX1 was important solely for its interaction with p450 enzymes to synthesize mitochondrial steroid precursors, whereas FDX2 was used for synthesis of iron–sulfur clusters, but not steroidogenesis. To further assess the role of the FDX–FDXR system in mammalian iron–sulfur cluster biogenesis, we performed siRNA studies on FDX1 and FDX2, on several human cell lines, using oligonucleotides identical to those previously used, along with new oligonucleotides that specifically targeted each gene. We concluded that both FDX1 and FDX2 were important in iron–sulfur cluster biogenesis. Loss of FDX1 activity disrupted activity of iron–sulfur cluster enzymes and cellular iron homeostasis, causing mitochondrial iron overload and cytosolic iron depletion. Moreover, knockdown of the sole human ferredoxin reductase, FDXR, diminished iron–sulfur cluster assembly and caused mitochondrial iron overload in conjunction with cytosolic depletion. Our studies suggest that interference with any of the three related genes, FDX1, FDX2 or FDXR, disrupts iron–sulfur cluster assembly and maintenance of normal cytosolic and mitochondrial iron homeostasis.}},

The oncogenic RAS-selective lethal small molecule erastin triggers a unique iron-dependent form of nonapoptotic cell death that we term ferroptosis. Ferroptosis is dependent upon intracellular iron, but not other metals, and is morphologically, biochemically, and genetically distinct from apoptosis, necrosis, and autophagy. We identify the small molecule ferrostatin-1 as a potent inhibitor of ferroptosis in cancer cells and glutamate-induced cell death in organotypic rat brain slices, suggesting similarities between these two processes. Indeed, erastin, like glutamate, inhibits cystine uptake by the cystine/glutamate antiporter (system x c − ), creating a void in the antioxidant defenses of the cell and ultimately leading to iron-dependent, oxidative death. Thus, activation of ferroptosis results in the nonapoptotic destruction of certain cancer cells, whereas inhibition of this process may protect organisms from neurodegeneration. PaperFlick}},

The components and molecular mechanisms involved in the assembly of the Fe/S clusters have been identified only partially. In eukaryotes, mitochondria have been proposed to execute a crucial task in the generation of intramitochondrial and extramitochondrial Fe/S proteins. Herein, we identify the essential ferredoxin Yah1p of Saccharomyces cerevisiae mitochondria as a central component of the Fe/S protein biosynthesis machinery. Depletion of Yah1p by regulated gene expression resulted in a 30-fold accumulation of iron within mitochondria, similar to what has been reported for other components involved in Fe/S protein biogenesis. Yah1p was shown to be required for the assembly of Fe/S proteins both inside mitochondria and in the cytosol. Apparently, at least one of the steps of Fe/S cluster biogenesis within mitochondria requires reduction by ferredoxin. Our findings lend support to the idea of a primary function of mitochondria in the biosynthesis of Fe/S proteins outside the organelle. To our knowledge, Yah1p is the first member of the ferredoxin family for which a function in Fe/S cluster formation has been established. A similar role may be predicted for the bacterial homologs that are encoded within iron-sulfur cluster assembly (isc) operons of prokaryotes.}},

Under noninducing conditions, cellular iron uptake was dysregulated, exhibiting a failure to repress in response to medium iron. Iron trafficking within the cell was also disturbed. Exposure of Arh1p-depleted cells to increasing iron concentrations during growth led to drastic increases in mitochondrial iron, indicating a loss of homeostatic control. Activity of aconitase, a prototype Fe-S protein, was deficient at all concentrations of mitochondrial iron, although the protein level was unaltered. Heme protein deficiencies were exacerbated in the iron-loaded mitochondria, suggesting a toxic side effect of accumulated iron. Finally, a time course correlated the cellular depletion of Arh1p with the coordinated appearance of various mutant phenotypes including dysregulated cellular iron uptake, deficiency of Fe-S protein activities in mitochondria and cytoplasm, and deficiency of hemoproteins. Thus, Arh1p is required for control of cellular and mitochondrial iron levels and for the activities of Fe-S cluster proteins.}},

Although dysfunction of mitochondria has been implicated in tumorigenesis, little is known about the roles of mitochondrial dynamics in metastasis, the major cause of cancer death. In the present study, we found a marked upregulation of mitochondrial fission protein dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1) expression in human invasive breast carcinoma and metastases to lymph nodes. Compared with non-metastatic breast cancer cells, mitochondria also were more fragmented in metastatic breast cancer cells that express higher levels of total and active Drp1 and less mitochondrial fusion protein 1 (Mfn1). Silencing Drp1 or overexpression of Mfn1 resulted in mitochondria elongation or clusters, respectively, and significantly suppressed metastatic abilities of breast cancer cells. In contrast, silencing Mfn proteins led to mitochondrial fragmentation and enhanced metastatic abilities of breast cancer cells. Interestingly, these manipulations of mitochondrial dynamics altered the subcellular distribution of mitochondria in breast cancer cells. For example, silencing Drp1 or overexpression of Mfn1 inhibited lamellipodia formation, a key step for cancer metastasis, and suppressed chemoattractant-induced recruitment of mitochondria to lamellipodial regions. Conversely, silencing Mfn proteins resulted in more cell spreading and lamellipodia formation, causing accumulation of more mitochondria in lamellipodia regions. More importantly, treatment with a mitochondrial uncoupling agent or adenosine triphosphate synthesis inhibitor reduced lamellipodia formation and decreased breast cancer cell migration and invasion, suggesting a functional importance of mitochondria in breast cancer metastasis. Together, our findings show a new role and mechanism for regulation of cancer cell migration and invasion by mitochondrial dynamics. Thus targeting dysregulated Drp1-dependent mitochondrial fission may provide a novel strategy for suppressing breast cancer metastasis.}},

Further, because driver oncogenes exert dominant control over mitochondrial dynamics, oncogene-targeted therapies can be used to sensitize tumors to SMAC mimetics via their effects on fission/fusion dynamics. Collectively, these data demonstrate that perturbations to the mitochondrial dynamics network induce targetable vulnerabilities across diverse human tumors and, more broadly, suggest that the altered structures, activities, and trafficking of cellular organelles may facilitate additional cancer therapeutic opportunities.

However, determined characteristics of PCD such as loss in mitochondrial reductase activity or cytolysis can be induced in enucleated cells, indicating cytoplasmic PCD control. Here we report a sequential disregulation of mitochondrial function that precedes cell shrinkage and nuclear fragmentation. A first cyclosporin A-inhibitable step of ongoing PCD is characterized by a reduction of mitochondrial transmembrane potential, as determined by specific fluorochromes (5,5',6,6'-tetrachloro-1,1',3,3'-tetraethylbenzimidazolcarbocyanine++ + iodide; 3,3'dihexyloxacarbocyanine iodide). Cytofluorometrically purified cells with reduced mitochondrial transmembrane potential are initially incapable of oxidizing hydroethidine (HE) into ethidium. Upon short-term in vitro culture, such cells acquire the capacity of HE oxidation, thus revealing a second step of PCD marked by mitochondrial generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). This step can be selectively inhibited by rotenone and ruthenium red yet is not affected by cyclosporin A. Finally, cells reduce their volume, a step that is delayed by radical scavengers, indicating the implication of ROS in the apoptotic process. This sequence of alterations accompanying early PCD is found in very different models of apoptosis induction: glucocorticoid-induced death of lymphocytes, activation-induced PCD of T cell hybridomas, and tumor necrosis factor-induced death of U937 cells. Transfection with the antiapoptotic protooncogene Bcl-2 simultaneously inhibits mitochondrial alterations and apoptotic cell death triggered by steroids or ceramide. In vivo injection of fluorochromes such as 5,5',6,6'-tetrachloro-1,1',3,3'-tetraethylbenzimidazolcarbocyanine iodide; 3,3'dihexyloxacarbocyanine iodide; or HE allows for the detection of cells that are programmed for death but still lack nuclear DNA fragmentation. In particular, assessment of mitochondrial ROS generation provides an accurate picture of PCD-mediated lymphocyte depletion. In conclusion, alterations of mitochondrial function constitute an important feature of early PCD.}},

abstract = {{In a number of experimental systems in which lymphocyte depletion was induced by apoptosis-inducing manipulations, no apoptotic morphology and ladder-type DNA fragmentation were detected among freshly isolated peripheral lymphocytes ex vivo. Here we report that one alteration that can be detected among splenocytes stimulated with lymphocyte-depleting doses of dexamethasone (DEX) in vivo is a reduced uptake of 3,3'dihexyloxacarbocyanine iodide (DiOC6[3]), a fluorochrome which incorporates into cells dependent upon their mitochondrial transmembrane potential (delta psi m). In contrast, ex vivo isolated splenocytes still lacked established signs of programmed cell death (PCD):DNA degradation into high or low molecular weight fragments, ultrastructural changes of chromatin arrangement and endoplasmatic reticulum, loss in viability, or accumulation of intracellular peroxides. Moreover, no changes in cell membrane potential could be detected. A reduced delta psi m has been observed in response to different agents inducing lymphoid cell depletion in vivo (superantigen and glucocorticoids [GC]), in mature T and B lymphocytes, as well as their precursors. DEX treatment in vivo, followed by cytofluorometric purification of viable delta psi mlow splenic T cells ex vivo, revealed that this fraction of cells is irreversibly committed to undergoing DNA fragmentation. Immediately after purification neither delta psi mlow, nor delta psi mhigh cells, exhibit detectable DNA fragmentation. However, after short-term culture (37 degrees C, 1 h) delta psi mlow cells show endonucleolysis, followed by cytolysis several hours later. Incubation of delta psi mlow cells in the presence of excess amount of the GC receptor antagonist RU38486 (which displaces DEX from the GC receptor), cytokines that inhibit DEX-induced cell death, or cycloheximide fails to prevent cytolysis. The antioxidant, N-acetylcysteine, as well as linomide, an agent that effectively inhibits DEX or superantigen-induced lymphocyte depletion in vivo, also stabilize the DiOC6(3) uptake. In contrast, the endonuclease inhibitor, aurintricarboxylic acid acts at later stages of apoptosis and only retards the transition from the viable delta psi mlow to the nonviable fraction. Altogether, these data suggest a sequence of PCD-associated events in which a reduction in delta psi m constitutes an obligate irreversible step of ongoing lymphocyte death, preceding other alterations of cellular physiology, and thus allowing for the ex vivo assessment of PCD.}},

Cytoplasmic structures including mitochondria have been shown to participate in the control of apoptotic nuclear disintegration. Before cells exhibit common signs of nuclear apoptosis (chromatin condensation and endonuclease-mediated DNA fragmentation), they undergo a reduction of the mitochondrial transmembrane potential (delta psi m) that may be due to the opening of mitochondrial permeability transition (PT) pores. Here, we present direct evidence indicating that mitochondrial PT constitutes a critical early event of the apoptotic process. In a cell-free system combining purified mitochondria and nuclei, mitochondria undergoing PT suffice to induce chromatin condensation and DNA fragmentation. Induction of PT by pharmacological agents augments the apoptosis-inducing potential of mitochondria. In contrast, prevention of PT by pharmacological agents impedes nuclear apoptosis, both in vitro and in vivo. Mitochondria from hepatocytes or lymphoid cells undergoing apoptosis, but not those from normal cells, induce disintegration of isolated Hela nuclei. A specific ligand of the mitochondrial adenine nucleotide translocator (ANT), bongkreik acid, inhibits PT and reduces apoptosis induction by mitochondria in a cell-free system. Moreover, it inhibits the induction of apoptosis in intact cells. Several pieces of evidence suggest that the proto-oncogene product Bcl-2 inhibits apoptosis by preventing mitochondrial PT. First, to inhibit nuclear apoptosis, Bcl-2 must be localized in mitochondrial but not nuclear membranes. Second, transfection-enforced hyperexpression of Bcl-2 directly abolishes the induction of mitochondrial PT in response to a protonophore, a pro-oxidant, as well as to the ANT ligand atractyloside, correlating with its apoptosis-inhibitory effect. In conclusion, mitochondrial PT appears to be a critical step of the apoptotic cascade.}},

We show that copper-dependent death occurs by means of direct binding of copper to lipoylated components of the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle.

However, we currently do not understand the mechanism by which copper brought into cells as ES–Cu(II) is released and delivered to cuproenzymes present in different subcellular compartments. Here, we have utilized a combination of genetic, biochemical, and cell-biological approaches to demonstrate that intracellular release of copper from ES occurs inside and outside of mitochondria. The mitochondrial matrix reductase, FDX1, catalyzes the reduction of ES–Cu(II) to Cu(I), releasing it into mitochondria where it is bioavailable for the metalation of mitochondrial cuproenzyme— cytochrome c oxidase. Consistently, ES fails to rescue cytochrome c oxidase abundance and activity in copper-deficient cells lacking FDX1. In the absence of FDX1, the ES-dependent increase in cellular copper is attenuated but not abolished. Thus, ES-mediated copper delivery to nonmitochondrial cuproproteins continues even in the absence of FDX1, suggesting alternate mechanism(s) of copper release. Importantly, we demonstrate that this mechanism of copper transport by ES is distinct from other clinically used copper-transporting drugs. Our study uncovers a unique mode of intracellular copper delivery by ES and may further aid in repurposing this anticancer drug for copper deficiency disorders.}},

abstract = {{Background: Kidney renal clear cell carcinoma (KIRC) is not sensitive to radiotherapy and chemotherapy, and only some KIRC patients can benefit from immunotherapy and targeted therapy. Cuproptosis is a new mechanism of cell death, which is closely related to tumor progression, prognosis and immunity. The identification of prognostic markers related to cuproptosis in KIRC may provide targets for treatment and improve the prognosis of KIRC patients. Methods: Ten cuproptosis-related genes were analyzed for differential expression in KIRC-TCGA and a prognostic model was constructed. Nomogram diagnostic model was used to screen independent prognostic molecules. The screened molecules were verified in multiple datasets (GSE36895 and GSE53757), and in KIRC tumor tissues by RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry (IHC). Clinical correlation of cuproptosis-related independent prognostic molecules was analyzed. According to the molecular expression, the two groups were divided into high and low expression groups, and the differences of immune checkpoint and tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) between the two groups were compared by EPIC algorithm. The potential Immune checkpoint blocking (ICB) response of high and low expression groups was predicted by the “TIDE” algorithm. Results: FDX1 and DLAT were protective factors, while CDKN2A was a risk factor. FDX1 was an independent prognostic molecule by Nomogram, and low expressed in tumor tissues compared with adjacent tissues (p < 0.05). FDX1 was positively correlated with CD274, HAVCR2, PDCD1LG2, and negatively correlated with CTLA4, LAG3, and PDCD1. The TIDE score of low-FDX1 group was higher than that of high-FDX1 group. The abundance of CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells and Endothelial cells in FDX1-low group was lower than that in FDX1-high group (p < 0.05). Conclusion: FDX1, as a key cuproptosis-related gene, was also an independent prognostic molecule of KIRC. FDX1 might become an interesting biomarker and potential therapeutic target for KIRC.}},

In the past, elesclomol was recognized as an inducer of oxidative stress, but now it has also been found to suppress cancer by inducing cuproptosis. Elesclomol’s anticancer activity is determined by the dependence of cancer on mitochondrial metabolism. The mitochondrial metabolism of cancer stem cells, cancer cells resistant to platinum drugs, proteasome inhibitors, molecularly targeted drugs, and cancer cells with inhibited glycolysis was significantly enhanced. Elesclomol exhibited tremendous toxicity to all three kinds of cells. Elesclomol's toxicity to cells is highly dependent on its transport of extracellular copper ions, a process involved in cuproptosis. The discovery of cuproptosis has perfected the specific cancer suppressor mechanism of elesclomol. For some time, elesclomol failed to yield favorable results in oncology clinical trials, but its safety in clinical application was confirmed. Research progress on the relationship between elesclomol, mitochondrial metabolism and cuproptosis provides a possibility to explore the reapplication of elesclomol in the clinic. New clinical trials should selectively target cancer types with high mitochondrial metabolism and attempt to combine elesclomol with platinum, proteasome inhibitors, molecularly targeted drugs, or glycolysis inhibitors. Herein, the particular anticancer mechanism of elesclomol and its relationship with mitochondrial metabolism and cuproptosis will be presented, which may shed light on the better application of elesclomol in clinical tumor treatment.}},

Although elesclomol displays significant therapeutic activity in the clinic, the mechanism underlying its anticancer activity has not been defined previously. Here, we show that elesclomol induces apoptosis in cancer cells through the induction of oxidative stress. Treatment of cancer cells in vitro with elesclomol resulted in the rapid generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the induction of a transcriptional gene profile characteristic of an oxidative stress response. Inhibition of oxidative stress by the antioxidant N-acetylcysteine blocked the induction of gene transcription by elesclomol. In addition, N-acetylcysteine blocked drug-induced apoptosis, indicating that ROS generation is the primary mechanism responsible for the proapoptotic activity of elesclomol. Excessive ROS production and elevated levels of oxidative stress are critical biochemical alterations that contribute to cancer cell growth. Thus, the induction of oxidative stress by elesclomol exploits this unique characteristic of cancer cells by increasing ROS levels beyond a threshold that triggers cell death.

Elesclomol preferentially chelates copper (Cu) outside of cells and enters as elesclomol–Cu(II). The elesclomol–Cu(II) complex then rapidly and selectively transports the copper to mitochondria. In this organelle Cu(II) is reduced to Cu(I), followed by subsequent ROS generation. Upon dissociation from the complex, elesclomol is effluxed from cells and repeats shuttling elesclomol–Cu complexes from the extracellular to the intracellular compartments, leading to continued copper accumulation within mitochondria. An optimal range of redox potentials exhibited by copper chelates of elesclomol and its analogs correlated with the elevation of mitochondrial Cu(I) levels and cytotoxic activity, suggesting that redox reduction of the copper triggers mitochondrial ROS induction. Importantly the mitochondrial selectivity exhibited by elesclomol is a distinct characteristic of the compound that is not shared by other chelators, including disulfiram.

abstract = {{Iron accumulation is a key mediator of several cytotoxic mechanisms leading to the impairment of redox homeostasis and cellular death. Iron overload is often associated with haematological diseases which require regular blood transfusion/phlebotomy, and it represents a common complication in thalassaemic patients. Major damages predominantly occur in the liver and the heart, leading to a specific form of cell death recently named ferroptosis. Different from apoptosis, necrosis, and autophagy, ferroptosis is strictly dependent on iron and reactive oxygen species, with a dysregulation of mitochondrial structure/function. Susceptibility to ferroptosis is dependent on intracellular antioxidant capacity and varies according to the different cell types. Chemotherapy-induced cardiotoxicity has been proven to be mediated predominantly by iron accumulation and ferroptosis, whereas there is evidence about the role of ferritin in protecting cardiomyocytes from ferroptosis and consequent heart failure. Another paradigmatic organ for transfusion-associated complication due to iron overload is the liver, in which the role of ferroptosis is yet to be elucidated. Some studies report a role of ferroptosis in the initiation of hepatic inflammation processes while others provide evidence about an involvement in several pathologies including immune-related hepatitis and acute liver failure. In this manuscript, we aim to review the literature to address putative common features between the response to ferroptosis in the heart and liver. A better comprehension of (dys)similarities is pivotal for the development of future therapeutic strategies that can be designed to specifically target this type of cell death in an attempt to minimize iron-overload effects in specific organs.}},

abstract = {{Iron is vital for many physiological functions, including energy production, and dysregulated iron homeostasis underlies a number of pathologies. Ferroptosis is a recently recognized form of regulated cell death that is characterized by iron dependency and lipid peroxidation, and this process has been reported to be involved in multiple diseases. The mechanisms underlying ferroptosis are complex, and involve both well-described pathways (including the iron-induced Fenton reaction, impaired antioxidant capacity, and mitochondrial dysfunction) and novel interactions linked to cellular energy production. In this review, we examine the contribution of iron to diverse metabolic activities and their relationship to ferroptosis. There is an emphasis on the role of iron in driving energy production and its link to ferroptosis under both physiological and pathological conditions. In conclusion, excess reactive oxygen species production driven by disordered iron metabolism, which induces Fenton reaction and/or impairs mitochondrial function and energy metabolism, is a key inducer of ferroptosis.}},

abstract = {{Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a chronic progressive disease characterized by excessive proliferation of fibroblasts and excessive accumulation of extracellular matrix (ECM). Ferroptosis is a novel form of cell death characterized by the lethal accumulation of iron and lipid peroxidation, which is associated with many diseases. Our study addressed the potential role played by ferroptosis and iron accumulation in the progression of pulmonary fibrosis. We found that the inducers of pulmonary fibrosis and injury, namely, bleomycin (BLM) and lipopolysaccharide (LPS), induced ferroptosis of lung epithelial cells. Both the ferroptosis inhibitor liproxstatin-1 (Lip-1) and the iron chelator deferoxamine (DFO) alleviated the symptoms of pulmonary fibrosis induced by bleomycin or LPS. TGF-β stimulation upregulated the expression of transferrin receptor protein 1 (TFRC) in the human lung fibroblast cell line (MRC-5) and mouse primary lung fibroblasts, resulting in increased intracellular Fe2+, which promoted the transformation of fibroblasts into myofibroblasts. Mechanistically, TGF-β enhanced the expression and nuclear localization of the transcriptional coactivator tafazzin (TAZ), which combined with the transcription factor TEA domain protein (TEAD)-4 to promote the transcription of TFRC. In addition, elevated Fe2+ failed to induce the ferroptosis of fibroblasts, which might be related to the regulation of iron export and lipid metabolism. Finally, we specifically knocked out TFRC expression in fibroblasts in mice, and compared with those in the control mice, the symptoms of pulmonary fibrosis were reduced in the knockout mice after bleomycin induction. Collectively, these findings suggest the therapeutic potential of ferroptosis inhibitors and iron chelators in treating pulmonary fibrosis.}},

abstract = {{Activation of the pro-apoptotic protein Bax under intracellular oxidative stress is closely related to its association with the mitochondrial outer membrane (MOM) system, ultimately resulting in cell death. The precise mechanism by which this activation and the subsequent structural changes in the protein occur is currently unknown. In addition to triggering the onset of apoptosis, oxidative stress generates oxidized lipids whose impact on mitochondrial membrane integrity and the activity of membrane-associated Bax is unclear. We therefore devised a model system that mimics oxidative stress conditions by incorporating oxidized phospholipids (OxPls) into mitochondria-like liposomes, and studied the OxPls' impact on Bax-membrane interactions. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) was used to study membrane organization and protein stability, while conformational changes in the protein upon contact with lipid vesicles were monitored using far-UV circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy. The thermograms for liposomes containing the OxPl 1-palmitoyl-2-azelaoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (PazePC) differed dramatically from those for unmodified liposomes. Moreover, Bax exhibited enhanced thermal stability in the presence of the modified liposomes, indicating that it interacted strongly with PazePC-containing membranes. The presence of PazePC also increased the α-helical character of Bax compared to the protein alone or with PazePC-free vesicles, at 10°C, 20°C, and 37°C. Presumably, the presence of PazePC-like OxPls a) increases the population of membrane-associated Bax and b) facilitates the protein's insertion into the membrane by distorting the bilayer's organization, as seen by solid-state high-resolution 1H and 31P magic angle spinning nuclear magnetic resonance (MAS NMR) spectroscopy.}},

abstract = {{ Mitochondria play a crucial role in programmed cell death via the intrinsic apoptotic pathway, which is tightly regulated by the B-cell CLL/lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2) protein family. Intracellular oxidative stress causes the translocation of Bax, a pro-apoptotic family member, to the mitochondrial outer membrane (MOM) where it induces membrane permeabilization. Oxidized phospholipids (OxPls) generated in the MOM during oxidative stress directly affect the onset and progression of mitochondria-mediated apoptosis. Here we use MOM-mimicking lipid vesicles doped with varying concentrations of 1-palmitoyl-2-azelaoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (PazePC), an OxPl species known to significantly enhance Bax-membrane association, to investigate three key aspects of Bax's action at the MOM: 1) induction of Bax pores in membranes without additional mediator proteins, 2) existence of a threshold OxPl concentration required for Bax-membrane action and 3) mechanism by which PazePC disturbs membrane organization to facilitate Bax penetration. Fluorescence leakage studies revealed that Bax-induced leakage, especially its rate, increased with the vesicles' PazePC content without any detectable threshold neither for OxPl nor Bax. Moreover, the leakage rate correlated with the Bax to lipid ratio and the PazePC content. Solid state NMR studies and calorimetric experiments on the lipid vesicles confirmed that OxPl incorporation disrupted the membrane's organization, enabling Bax to penetrate into the membrane. In addition, 15N cross polarization (CP) and insensitive nuclei enhanced by polarization transfer (INEPT) MAS NMR experiments using uniformly 15N-labeled Bax revealed dynamically restricted helical segments of Bax embedded in the membrane, while highly flexible protein segments were located outside or at the membrane surface.}},
