abstract = {{The mechanisms by which cells adapt to proteotoxic stress are largely unknown, but are key to understanding how tumor cells, particularly in vivo, are largely resistant to proteasome inhibitors. Analysis of cancer cell lines, mouse xenografts and patient-derived tumor samples all showed an association between mitochondrial metabolism and proteasome inhibitor sensitivity. When cells were forced to use oxidative phosphorylation rather than glycolysis, they became proteasome-inhibitor resistant. This mitochondrial state, however, creates a unique vulnerability: sensitivity to the small molecule compound elesclomol. Genome-wide CRISPR–Cas9 screening showed that a single gene, encoding the mitochondrial reductase FDX1, could rescue elesclomol-induced cell death. Enzymatic function and nuclear-magnetic-resonance-based analyses further showed that FDX1 is the direct target of elesclomol, which promotes a unique form of copper-dependent cell death. These studies explain a fundamental mechanism by which cells adapt to proteotoxic stress and suggest strategies to mitigate proteasome inhibitor resistance. Mitochondrial energy metabolism regulates proteotoxic stress tolerance, exposing a newly discovered sensitivity to the small molecule elesclomol, which induces FDX1-mediated, copper-dependent cell death.}},

abstract = {{Ferroptosis is considered a distinctive form of cell death compared to other types of death such as apoptosis. It is known to result from iron-dependent accumulation of lipid peroxides rather than caspase activation. However, we reported recently that ferroptosis interplays with apoptosis. In this study, we investigated a possible mechanism of this interplay between ferroptosis and apoptosis. Results from our studies reveal that combined treatment of the ferroptotic agent erastin and the apoptotic agent TRAIL effectively disrupted mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm) and subsequently promoted caspase activation. The alterations of mitochondrial membrane potential are probably due to an increase in oligomerization of BAX and its accumulation at the mitochondria during treatment with erastin and TRAIL. Interestingly, the combined treatment-promoted apoptosis was effectively inhibited in BAX-deficient HCT116 cells, but not BAK-deficient cells. These results indicate that the BAX-associated mitochondria-dependent pathway plays a pivotal role in erastin-enhanced TRAIL-induced apoptosis.}},

abstract = {{Patients with high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSC) frequently receive platinum-based chemotherapeutics, such as cisplatin. Cisplatin binds to DNA and induces DNA-damage culminating in mitochondria-mediated apoptosis. Interestingly, mitochondrial DNA is critically affected by cisplatin but its relevance in cell death induction is scarcely investigated. We find that cisplatin sensitive HGSC cell lines contain higher mitochondrial content and higher levels of mitochondrial ROS (mtROS) than cells resistant to cisplatin induced cell death. In clonal sub-lines from OVCAR-3 mitochondrial content and basal oxygen consumption rate correlate with sensitivity to cisplatin induced apoptosis. Mitochondria are in two ways pivotal for cisplatin sensitivity because not only knock-down of BAX and BAK but also the ROS scavenger glutathione diminish cisplatin induced apoptosis. Mitochondrial ROS correlates with mitochondrial content and reduction of mitochondrial biogenesis by knock-down of transcription factors PGC1α or TFAM attenuates both mtROS induction and cisplatin induced apoptosis. Increasing mitochondrial ROS by inhibition or knock-down of the ROS-protective uncoupling protein UCP2 enhances cisplatin induced apoptosis. Similarly, enhancing ROS by high-dose ascorbic acid or H2O2 augments cisplatin induced apoptosis. In summary, mitochondrial content and the resulting mitochondrial capacity to produce ROS critically determine HGSC cell sensitivity to cisplatin induced apoptosis. In line with this observation, data from the human protein atlas (www.proteinatlas.org) indicates that high expression of mitochondrial marker proteins (TFAM and TIMM23) is a favorable prognostic factor in ovarian cancer patients. Thus, we propose mitochondrial content as a biomarker for the response to platinum-based therapies. Functionally, this might be exploited by increasing mitochondrial content or mitochondrial ROS production to enhance sensitivity to cisplatin based anti-cancer therapies.}},

Two ferredoxins, human mitochondrial ferredoxin 1 (FDX1) and human mitochondrial ferredoxin 2 (FDX2), are present in the matrix of human mitochondria. Conflicting results have been reported regarding their respective function in mitochondrial iron–sulfur cluster biogenesis. We report here biophysical studies of the interaction of these two ferredoxins with other proteins involved in mitochondrial iron–sulfur cluster assembly. Results from nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy show that both FDX1 and FDX2 (in both their reduced and oxidized states) interact with the protein complex responsible for cluster assembly, which contains cysteine desulfurase (NFS1), ISD11 (also known as LYRM4), and acyl carrier protein (Acp). In all cases, ferredoxin residues close to the Fe–S cluster are involved in the interaction with this complex. Isothermal titration calorimetry results showed that FDX2 binds more tightly to the cysteine desulfurase complex than FDX1 does. The reduced form of each ferredoxin became oxidized in the presence of the cysteine desulfurase complex when l-cysteine was added, leading to its conversion to l-alanine and the generation of sulfide. In an in vitro reaction, the reduced form of each ferredoxin was found to support Fe–S cluster assembly on ISCU; the rate of cluster assembly was faster with FDX2 than with FDX1. Taken together, these results show that both FDX1 and FDX2 can function in Fe–S cluster assembly in vitro.}},

As a member of the [2Fe-2S] cluster-containing ferredoxin family, Fdx1 reduces mitochondrial cytochrome P450 enzymes, which then catalyze; e.g., the conversion of cholesterol to pregnenolone, aldosterone, and cortisol. The high protein sequence similarity between Fdx1 and its yeast adrenodoxin homologue (Yah1) suggested that Fdx1, like Yah1, may be involved in the biosynthesis of heme A and Fe/S clusters, two versatile and essential protein cofactors. Our study, employing RNAi technology to deplete human Fdx1, did not confirm this expectation. Instead, we identified a Fdx1-related mitochondrial protein, designated ferredoxin 2 (Fdx2) and found it to be essential for heme A and Fe/S protein biosynthesis. Unlike Fdx1, Fdx2 was unable to efficiently reduce mitochondrial cytochromes P450 and convert steroids, indicating that the two ferredoxin isoforms are highly specific for their substrates in distinct biochemical pathways. Moreover, Fdx2 deficiency had a severe impact, via impaired Fe/S protein biogenesis, on cellular iron homeostasis, leading to increased cellular iron uptake and iron accumulation in mitochondria. We conclude that mammals depend on two distinct mitochondrial ferredoxins for the specific production of either steroid hormones or heme A and Fe/S proteins.}},

More recently, studies in bacteria and yeast have demonstrated important roles for ferredoxin and ferredoxin reductase in iron–sulfur cluster assembly. The human genome contains two homologous ferredoxins, ferredoxin 1 (FDX1) and ferredoxin 2 (FDX2 — formerly known as ferredoxin 1L). More recently, the roles of these two human ferredoxins in iron–sulfur cluster assembly were assessed, and it was concluded that FDX1 was important solely for its interaction with p450 enzymes to synthesize mitochondrial steroid precursors, whereas FDX2 was used for synthesis of iron–sulfur clusters, but not steroidogenesis. To further assess the role of the FDX–FDXR system in mammalian iron–sulfur cluster biogenesis, we performed siRNA studies on FDX1 and FDX2, on several human cell lines, using oligonucleotides identical to those previously used, along with new oligonucleotides that specifically targeted each gene. We concluded that both FDX1 and FDX2 were important in iron–sulfur cluster biogenesis. Loss of FDX1 activity disrupted activity of iron–sulfur cluster enzymes and cellular iron homeostasis, causing mitochondrial iron overload and cytosolic iron depletion. Moreover, knockdown of the sole human ferredoxin reductase, FDXR, diminished iron–sulfur cluster assembly and caused mitochondrial iron overload in conjunction with cytosolic depletion. Our studies suggest that interference with any of the three related genes, FDX1, FDX2 or FDXR, disrupts iron–sulfur cluster assembly and maintenance of normal cytosolic and mitochondrial iron homeostasis.}},

Elesclomol–copper complexes can cause oxidative stress by disruption of the mitochondrial respiration chain or by indirect non‐mitochondrial induction of reactive oxygen species. We have found that elesclomol effectively kills the slow‐cycling subpopulation and prevents the selective enrichment for slow‐cycling cells, which usually results after monotreatment.

We show that copper-dependent death occurs by means of direct binding of copper to lipoylated components of the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle.

However, we currently do not understand the mechanism by which copper brought into cells as ES–Cu(II) is released and delivered to cuproenzymes present in different subcellular compartments. Here, we have utilized a combination of genetic, biochemical, and cell-biological approaches to demonstrate that intracellular release of copper from ES occurs inside and outside of mitochondria. The mitochondrial matrix reductase, FDX1, catalyzes the reduction of ES–Cu(II) to Cu(I), releasing it into mitochondria where it is bioavailable for the metalation of mitochondrial cuproenzyme— cytochrome c oxidase. Consistently, ES fails to rescue cytochrome c oxidase abundance and activity in copper-deficient cells lacking FDX1. In the absence of FDX1, the ES-dependent increase in cellular copper is attenuated but not abolished. Thus, ES-mediated copper delivery to nonmitochondrial cuproproteins continues even in the absence of FDX1, suggesting alternate mechanism(s) of copper release. Importantly, we demonstrate that this mechanism of copper transport by ES is distinct from other clinically used copper-transporting drugs. Our study uncovers a unique mode of intracellular copper delivery by ES and may further aid in repurposing this anticancer drug for copper deficiency disorders.}},

abstract = {{Background: Kidney renal clear cell carcinoma (KIRC) is not sensitive to radiotherapy and chemotherapy, and only some KIRC patients can benefit from immunotherapy and targeted therapy. Cuproptosis is a new mechanism of cell death, which is closely related to tumor progression, prognosis and immunity. The identification of prognostic markers related to cuproptosis in KIRC may provide targets for treatment and improve the prognosis of KIRC patients. Methods: Ten cuproptosis-related genes were analyzed for differential expression in KIRC-TCGA and a prognostic model was constructed. Nomogram diagnostic model was used to screen independent prognostic molecules. The screened molecules were verified in multiple datasets (GSE36895 and GSE53757), and in KIRC tumor tissues by RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry (IHC). Clinical correlation of cuproptosis-related independent prognostic molecules was analyzed. According to the molecular expression, the two groups were divided into high and low expression groups, and the differences of immune checkpoint and tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) between the two groups were compared by EPIC algorithm. The potential Immune checkpoint blocking (ICB) response of high and low expression groups was predicted by the “TIDE” algorithm. Results: FDX1 and DLAT were protective factors, while CDKN2A was a risk factor. FDX1 was an independent prognostic molecule by Nomogram, and low expressed in tumor tissues compared with adjacent tissues (p < 0.05). FDX1 was positively correlated with CD274, HAVCR2, PDCD1LG2, and negatively correlated with CTLA4, LAG3, and PDCD1. The TIDE score of low-FDX1 group was higher than that of high-FDX1 group. The abundance of CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells and Endothelial cells in FDX1-low group was lower than that in FDX1-high group (p < 0.05). Conclusion: FDX1, as a key cuproptosis-related gene, was also an independent prognostic molecule of KIRC. FDX1 might become an interesting biomarker and potential therapeutic target for KIRC.}},

The mitochondrial metabolism of cancer stem cells, cancer cells resistant to platinum drugs, proteasome inhibitors, molecularly targeted drugs, and cancer cells with inhibited glycolysis was significantly enhanced. Elesclomol exhibited tremendous toxicity to all three kinds of cells.

The copper chelator elesclomol has been reported to have considerable anticancer efficacy, but the underlying mechanisms remain largely unknown. In this study, we found that elesclomol‐mediated copper overload inhibits colorectal cancer (CRC) both in vitro and in vivo. Elesclomol alone promotes the degradation of the copper transporter copper‐transporting ATPase 1 (ATP7A), which retards the proliferation of CRC cells. This property distinguishes it from several other copper chelators. Combinational treatment of elesclomol and copper leads to copper retention within mitochondria due to ATP7A loss, leading to reactive oxygen species accumulation, which in turn promotes the degradation of SLC7A11, thus further enhancing oxidative stress and consequent ferroptosis in CRC cells. This effect accounts for the robust antitumour activity of elesclomol against CRC, which can be reversed by the administration of antioxidants and ferroptosis inhibitors, as well as the overexpression of ATP7A. In summary, our findings indicate that elesclomol‐induced copper chelation inhibits CRC by targeting ATP7A and regulating ferroptosis. In this study, we describe the molecular mechanisms by which elesclomol‐mediated copper (Cu2+) overload inhibits colorectal cancer (CRC) both in vitro and in vivo. Elesclomol elevated Cu2+ levels in mitochondria and decreased the expression of the Cu2+ transporter ATP7A, leading to Cu2+ retention and the subsequent accumulation of reactive oxygen species. The process promoted the degradation of SLC7A11, which further enhanced oxidative stress and induced ferroptosis in CRC cells.}},

The cytotoxic effect of elesclomol in resistant cells is accompanied by further decreases in TRX and glutathione (GSH) antioxidant systems, while opposite results were found in parental cells. The ID50 of elesclomol in cisplatin-resistant cells ranged from 5–10 nM, which is well within clinically achievable ranges. N-Acetylcysteine (NAC), which is known to neutralize ROS, can abolish the cytotoxic effect of elesclomol, suggesting that the cytotoxic effect results from increased ROS. Overall, our data suggest that elesclomol selectively kills cisplatin-resistant tumor cells through increased ROS. This agent may hold potential to overcome cisplatin resistance and should be further explored to treat patients who have failed cisplatin therapy.}},

abstract = {{Objective Preclinical data suggest elesclomol increases oxidative stress and enhances sensitivity to cytotoxic agents. The objective of this prospective multicenter phase 2 trial was to estimate the activity of IV elesclomol plus weekly paclitaxel in patients with platinum-resistant recurrent ovarian, tubal or peritoneal cancer through the frequency of objective tumor responses (ORR). Methods Patients with measurable disease, acceptable organ function, performance status ≤ 2, and one prior platinum containing regimen were eligible. A two-stage design was utilized with a target sample size of 22 and 30 subjects, respectively. Prior Gynecologic Oncology Group studies within the same population involving single agent taxanes showed an ORR of approximately (20\%) and served as a historical control for direct comparison. The present study was designed to determine if the regimen had an ORR of ≥40\% with 90\% power. Results Fifty-eight patients were enrolled, of whom 2 received no study treatment and were inevaluable. The median number of cycles was 3 (268 total cycles, range 1–18). The number of patients responding was 11 (19.6\%; 90\% CI 11.4\% to 30.4\%) with one complete response. The median progression-free survival and overall survival was 3.6 months and 13.3 months, respectively. The median ORR duration was 9.2 months. Percentages of subjects with grade 3 toxicity included: Neutropenia 9\%; anemia 5\%; metabolic 5\%; nausea 4\%; infection 4\%; neurologic (mostly neuropathy) 4\%; and vascular (mostly thromboembolism) 4\%. There were no grade 4 toxicities reported. Conclusions This combination was well tolerated but is unworthy of further investigation based on the proportion responding [ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT00888615].}},

Recent studies have shown that iron-sulfur clusters are closely related to the mechanisms of multiple cell death modalities. In addition, numerous previous studies have demonstrated that iron-sulfur clusters play an important role in the development and treatment of cancer. This review first summarizes the close association of iron-sulfur clusters with cell death modalities such as ferroptosis, cuprotosis, PANoptosis, and apoptosis and their potential role in cancer activation and drug resistance. This review hopes to generate new cancer therapy ideas and overcome drug resistance by modulating iron-sulfur clusters.}},
