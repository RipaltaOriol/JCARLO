Although BMP signaling is required for synovial joint formation and is also involved in preserving joint function after birth, the role of specific BMP ligands in adult joint homeostasis remains unclear. The purpose of this study was to define the role of Bmp2 in the morphogenesis and maintenance of the knee joint. To do this, we first created Bmp2‐LacZ and Gdf5‐LacZ knock‐in mice and compared their expression patterns in the developing and postnatal murine knee joint. We then generated a knockout mouse model using the Gdf5‐cre transgene to specifically delete Bmp2 within synovial joint‐forming cells. Joint formation, maturation, and homeostasis were analyzed using histology, immunohistochemistry, qRT‐PCR, and atomic force microscopy (AFM)‐based nanoindentation to assess the cellular, molecular, and biomechanical changes in meniscus and articular cartilage. Bmp2 is expressed in the articular cartilage and meniscus of the embryonic and adult mouse knee in a pattern distinct from Gdf5. The knee joints of the Bmp2 knockout mice form normally but fail to mature properly. In the absence of Bmp2, the extracellular matrix and shape of the meniscus are altered, resulting in functional deficits in the meniscus and articular cartilage that lead to a progressive osteoarthritis (OA) like knee pathology as the animals age. These findings demonstrate that BMP activity provided by Bmp2 is required for the maturation and maintenance of the murine knee joint and reveal a unique role for Bmp2 that is distinct from Gdf5 in knee joint biology. © 2018 American Society for Bone and Mineral Research.",9,33

Mariani,Christina P. Ahn,Gail R. Martin",Nature,,,Nature,0028-0836,"The developing limb bud possesses a small ridge, the apical ectodermal ridge (AER), that produces signals controlling development of the limb along the proximal–distal axis (from the upper arms to the finger tips). Fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) are known to be key AER signals, but as four FGFs are expressed in the mouse AER, it has been difficult to understand their roles. Mariani et al. used genetic techniques to delete different combinations of FGFs from the mouse limb, thereby revealing the contribution made by each FGF to the total AER-FGF signal. Only one of the four AER-FGFs, Fgf8, was found to be essential for normal limb development. This dispels a longstanding notion that there is a positive feedback loop between the three other FGF genes expressed in the posterior AER and the sonic hedgehog gene. They also provide the first genetic evidence that the AER-FGFs serve as distalizing factors for establishing limb patterning, suggesting a role of FGFs as patterning molecules. They present a model that synthesizes the new findings with several other controversial papers published in recent years on the validity of the 'progress zone' versus the 'early specification' model of limb development. Genetic techniques have been used to delete different combinations of fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) from the mouse limb, to study the contribution that each FGF makes to the total apical ectodermal ridge (AER)–FGF signal. Out of the four AER–FGFs, it is shown that only one of them, Fgf8 is sufficient for normal limb development. This dispels a longstanding notion that there is a positive feedback loop between the three other FGF genes expressed in the posterior AER, and the sonic hedgehog gene. Half a century ago, the apical ectodermal ridge (AER) at the distal tip of the tetrapod limb bud was shown to produce signals necessary for development along the proximal–distal (P–D) axis, but how these signals influence limb patterning is still much debated1,2. Fibroblast growth factor (FGF) gene family members are key AER-derived signals3,4, with Fgf4, Fgf8, Fgf9 and Fgf17 expressed specifically in the mouse AER5. Here we demonstrate that mouse limbs lacking Fgf4, Fgf9 and Fgf17 have normal skeletal pattern, indicating that Fgf8 is sufficient among AER-FGFs to sustain normal limb formation. Inactivation of Fgf8 alone causes a mild skeletal phenotype6,7; however, when we also removed different combinations of the other AER-FGF genes, we obtained unexpected skeletal phenotypes of increasing severity, reflecting the contribution that each FGF can make to the total AER-FGF signal. Analysis of the compound mutant limb buds revealed that, in addition to sustaining cell survival, AER-FGFs regulate P–D-patterning gene expression during early limb bud development, providing genetic evidence that AER-FGFs function to specify a distal domain and challenging the long-standing hypothesis that AER-FGF signalling is permissive rather than instructive for limb patterning. We discuss how a two-signal model for P–D patterning can be integrated with the concept of early specification to explain the genetic data presented here.",7193,453,401-405

However, the fidelity of organoid models remains unclear3–5. Here we analyse the transcriptomes of individual primary human cortical cells from different developmental periods and cortical areas. We find that cortical development is characterized by progenitor maturation trajectories, the emergence of diverse cell subtypes and areal specification of newborn neurons. By contrast, organoids contain broad cell classes, but do not recapitulate distinct cellular subtype identities and appropriate progenitor maturation. Although the molecular signatures of cortical areas emerge in organoid neurons, they are not spatially segregated. Organoids also ectopically activate cellular stress pathways, which impairs cell-type specification. However, organoid stress and subtype defects are alleviated by transplantation into the mouse cortex. Together, these datasets and analytical tools provide a framework for evaluating and improving the accuracy of cortical organoids as models of human brain development. Single-cell RNA sequencing clarifies the development and specification of neurons in the human cortex and shows that cell stress impairs this process in cortical organoids.",7793,578,142-148

During development, spatial topography is determined by gradients of signaling molecules released from discrete signaling centers. We hypothesized that introduction of a signaling center into forebrain organoids would specify the positional identity of neural tissue in a distance-dependent manner. Here, we present a system to trigger a Sonic Hedgehog (SHH) protein gradient in developing forebrain organoids that enables ordered self-organization along dorso-ventral and antero-posterior positional axes. SHH-patterned forebrain organoids establish major forebrain subdivisions that are positioned with in vivo-like topography. Consistent with its behavior in vivo, SHH exhibits long-range signaling activity in organoids. Finally, we use SHH-patterned cerebral organoids as a tool to study the role of cholesterol metabolism in SHH signaling. Together, this work identifies inductive signaling as an effective organizing strategy to recapitulate in vivo-like topography in human brain organoids. Supplying forebrain organoids with a developmental signaling gradient induces topographical patterning along dorso-ventral and antero-posterior axes.",4,37,436-444

Krueger,Elaine Fuchs",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences,,,Proc National Acad Sci,0027-8424,"Aging manifests with architectural alteration and functional decline of multiple organs throughout an organism. In mammals, aged skin is accompanied by a marked reduction in hair cycling and appearance of bald patches, leading researchers to propose that hair follicle stem cells (HFSCs) are either lost, differentiate, or change to an epidermal fate during aging. Here, we employed single-cell RNA-sequencing to interrogate aging-related changes in the HFSCs. Surprisingly, although numbers declined, aging HFSCs were present, maintained their identity, and showed no overt signs of shifting to an epidermal fate. However, they did exhibit prevalent transcriptional changes particularly in extracellular matrix genes, and this was accompanied by profound structural perturbations in the aging SC niche. Moreover, marked age-related changes occurred in many nonepithelial cell types, including resident immune cells, sensory neurons, and arrector pili muscles. Each of these SC niche components has been shown to influence HF regeneration. When we performed skin injuries that are known to mobilize young HFSCs to exit their niche and regenerate HFs, we discovered that aged skin is defective at doing so. Interestingly, however, in transplantation assays in vivo, aged HFSCs regenerated HFs when supported with young dermis, while young HFSCs failed to regenerate HFs when combined with aged dermis. Together, our findings highlight the importance of SC:niche interactions and favor a model where youthfulness of the niche microenvironment plays a dominant role in dictating the properties of its SCs and tissue health and fitness.",10,117,5339-5350

Williams,Bahaar Chawla,Christian Apsey,Brenda L. Bohnsack",Birth Defects Research,,,Birth Defects Res,2472-1727,"Ethanol (ETOH) exposure during pregnancy is associated with craniofacial and neurologic abnormalities, but infrequently disrupts the anterior segment of the eye. In these studies, we used zebrafish to investigate differences in the teratogenic effect of ETOH on craniofacial, periocular, and ocular neural crest. Zebrafish eye and neural crest development was analyzed by means of live imaging, TUNEL (terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling) assay, immunostaining, detection of reactive oxygen species, and in situ hybridization. Our studies demonstrated that foxd3-positive neural crest cells in the periocular mesenchyme and developing eye were less sensitive to ETOH than sox10-positive craniofacial neural crest cells that form the pharyngeal arches and jaw. ETOH increased apoptosis in the retina, but did not affect survival of periocular and ocular neural crest cells. ETOH also did not increase reactive oxygen species within the eye. In contrast, ETOH increased ventral neural crest apoptosis and reactive oxygen species production in the facial mesenchyme. In the eye and craniofacial region, sod2 showed high levels of expression in the anterior segment and in the setting of Sod2 knockdown, low levels of ETOH decreased migration of foxd3-positive neural crest cells into the developing eye. However, ETOH had minimal effect on the periocular and ocular expression of transcription factors (pitx2 and foxc1) that regulate anterior segment development. Neural crest cells contributing to the anterior segment of the eye exhibit increased ability to withstand ETOH-induced oxidative stress and apoptosis. These studies explain the rarity of anterior segment dysgenesis despite the frequent craniofacial abnormalities in fetal alcohol syndrome.

Itch is mediated by peripheral sensory neurons, which originate from the neural crest (NC) during development. Itch-associated signaling molecules have been detected in genetically engineered animals and in cultures of peripheral neurons from dorsal root ganglia (DRG). Ethical difficulties collecting peripheral neurons from human DRG have limited analysis of itch in humans. This study describes a method of differentiating peripheral neurons from human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) for physiological study of itch. This method resulted in the robust induction of p75 and HNK1 double-positive NC cells from hiPSCs. The expression of NC markers TFAP2A, SOX10 and SNAI1 increased during NC induction. The induction efficiency was nearly 90%, and human peripheral neurons expressing peripherin were efficiently differentiated from hiPSC-derived NC cells. Moreover, induced peripheral neurons expressed the sensory neuronal marker BRN3A and the itch-related receptors HRH1, MRGPRX1, IL31R and IL-4R.

We assessed the safety, reactogenicity, and immunogenicity of a viral vectored coronavirus vaccine that expresses the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2. Methods We did a phase 1/2, single-blind, randomised controlled trial in five trial sites in the UK of a chimpanzee adenovirus-vectored vaccine (ChAdOx1 nCoV-19) expressing the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein compared with a meningococcal conjugate vaccine (MenACWY) as control. Healthy adults aged 18–55 years with no history of laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection or of COVID-19-like symptoms were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 at a dose of 5 × 1010 viral particles or MenACWY as a single intramuscular injection. A protocol amendment in two of the five sites allowed prophylactic paracetamol to be administered before vaccination. Ten participants assigned to a non-randomised, unblinded ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 prime-boost group received a two-dose schedule, with the booster vaccine administered 28 days after the first dose. Humoral responses at baseline and following vaccination were assessed using a standardised total IgG ELISA against trimeric SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, a muliplexed immunoassay, three live SARS-CoV-2 neutralisation assays (a 50% plaque reduction neutralisation assay [PRNT50]; a microneutralisation assay [MNA50, MNA80, and MNA90]; and Marburg VN), and a pseudovirus neutralisation assay. Cellular responses were assessed using an ex-vivo interferon-γ enzyme-linked immunospot assay. The co-primary outcomes are to assess efficacy, as measured by cases of symptomatic virologically confirmed COVID-19, and safety, as measured by the occurrence of serious adverse events. Analyses were done by group allocation in participants who received the vaccine. Safety was assessed over 28 days after vaccination. Here, we report the preliminary findings on safety, reactogenicity, and cellular and humoral immune responses. The study is ongoing, and was registered at ISRCTN, 15281137, and ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04324606. Findings Between April 23 and May 21, 2020, 1077 participants were enrolled and assigned to receive either ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (n=543) or MenACWY (n=534), ten of whom were enrolled in the non-randomised ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 prime-boost group. Local and systemic reactions were more common in the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 group and many were reduced by use of prophylactic paracetamol, including pain, feeling feverish, chills, muscle ache, headache, and malaise (all p<0·05). There were no serious adverse events related to ChAdOx1 nCoV-19. In the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 group, spike-specific T-cell responses peaked on day 14 (median 856 spot-forming cells per million peripheral blood mononuclear cells, IQR 493–1802; n=43). Anti-spike IgG responses rose by day 28 (median 157 ELISA units [EU], 96–317; n=127), and were boosted following a second dose (639 EU, 360–792; n=10). Neutralising antibody responses against SARS-CoV-2 were detected in 32 (91%) of 35 participants after a single dose when measured in MNA80 and in 35 (100%) participants when measured in PRNT50. After a booster dose, all participants had neutralising activity (nine of nine in MNA80 at day 42 and ten of ten in Marburg VN on day 56). Neutralising antibody responses correlated strongly with antibody levels measured by ELISA (R 2=0·67 by Marburg VN; p<0·001). Interpretation ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 showed an acceptable safety profile, and homologous boosting increased antibody responses. These results, together with the induction of both humoral and cellular immune responses, support large-scale evaluation of this candidate vaccine in an ongoing phase 3 programme.

Powers,Kruthika R. Katragadda,Geoffrey L. Cohen,Carol S. Dweck",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences,,,Proc National Acad Sci,0027-8424,"Many attractive jobs in today’s world require people to take on new challenges and figure out how to master them. As with any challenging goal, this involves systematic strategy use. Here we ask: Why are some people more likely to take a strategic stance toward their goals, and can this tendency be cultivated? To address these questions, we introduce the idea of a domain-general “strategic mindset.” This mindset involves asking oneself strategy-eliciting questions, such as “What can I do to help myself?”, “How else can I do this?”, or “Is there a way to do this even better?”, in the face of challenges or insufficient progress. In three studies (n = 864), people who scored higher on (or were primed with) a strategic mindset reported using more metacognitive strategies; in turn, they obtained higher college grade point averages (GPAs) (Study 1); reported greater progress toward their professional, educational, health, and fitness goals (Study 2); and responded to a challenging timed laboratory task by practicing it more and performing it faster (Study 3). We differentiated a strategic mindset from general self-efficacy, self-control, grit, and growth mindsets and showed that it explained unique variance in people’s use of metacognitive strategies. These findings suggest that being strategic entails more than just having specific metacognitive skills—it appears to also entail an orientation toward seeking and employing them.",25,117,14066-14072

Hammond,K.J. Brookes,M.J. Dixon",Journal of Dental Research,,,,0022-0345,"Cleft palate is a common birth defect that frequently occurs in human congenital malformations caused by mutations in components of the Sonic Hedgehog (SHH) signaling cascade. Shh is expressed in dynamic, spatiotemporal domains within epithelial rugae and plays a key role in driving epithelial-mesenchymal interactions that are central to development of the secondary palate. However, the gene regulatory networks downstream of Hedgehog (Hh) signaling are incompletely characterized. Here, we show that ectopic Hh signaling in the palatal mesenchyme disrupts oral-nasal patterning of the neural crest cell–derived ectomesenchyme of the palatal shelves, leading to defective palatine bone formation and fully penetrant cleft palate. We show that a series of Fox transcription factors, including the novel direct target Foxl1, function downstream of Hh signaling in the secondary palate. Furthermore, we demonstrate that Wnt/bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) antagonists, in particular Sostdc1, are positively regulated by Hh signaling, concomitant with downregulation of key regulators of osteogenesis and BMP signaling effectors. Our data demonstrate that ectopic Hh-Smo signaling downregulates Wnt/BMP pathways, at least in part by upregulating Sostdc1, resulting in cleft palate and defective osteogenesis.",13,97

Here, a simple approach to 3D‐print thick, vascularized, and perfusable cardiac patches that completely match the immunological, cellular, biochemical, and anatomical properties of the patient is reported. To this end, a biopsy of an omental tissue is taken from patients. While the cells are reprogrammed to become pluripotent stem cells, and differentiated to cardiomyocytes and endothelial cells, the extracellular matrix is processed into a personalized hydrogel. Following, the two cell types are separately combined with hydrogels to form bioinks for the parenchymal cardiac tissue and blood vessels. The ability to print functional vascularized patches according to the patient's anatomy is demonstrated. Blood vessel architecture is further improved by mathematical modeling of oxygen transfer. The structure and function of the patches are studied in vitro, and cardiac cell morphology is assessed after transplantation, revealing elongated cardiomyocytes with massive actinin striation. Finally, as a proof of concept, cellularized human hearts with a natural architecture are printed. These results demonstrate the potential of the approach for engineering personalized tissues and organs, or for drug screening in an appropriate anatomical structure and patient‐specific biochemical microenvironment. A small biopsy of an omental tissue is taken from patients. While the cells are reprogrammed to induce pluripotent stem cells and differentiate to cardiac and endothelial cells, the extra‐cellular matrix is processed into a thermoresponsive, hydrogel‐based bioink.

In this study, gonads from XX sex-reversed goats (PIS-/-) were thoroughly characterized at the molecular and histologic level from the first steps of gonadal differentiation (36 days post coitum [dpc]) to birth. The first histologic signs of gonadal sex reversal were detectable between 36 and 40 dpc (4–5 days later than the XY male) and were mainly characterized by the reduction of the ovarian cortex and the organization of seminiferous cords. As early as 36 dpc, aromatase (CYP19) gene expression was decreased in XX (PIS-/-) gonads, whereas genes normally up-regulated in males, such as SOX9 and AMH, showed an increased expression level from 40 dpc. Thereafter, steroidogenic cell precursors were affected, and at 56 dpc, WNT4 and 3β-HSD were expressed in a male-specific manner in sex-reversed gonads. Another noticeable feature was a progressive disappearance of germ cells, clearly visible in testicular cords around 70 dpc where 50–75% of germ cells were absent in XX (PIS-/-) gonads. These observations indicated that the causal mutation of PIS acts very early in the sex-determining cascade and affects primarily the supporting cells of the gonad. © 2002 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",1,224,39-50

Intracellular localization of exogenous mitochondria was confirmed by PCR, real-time PCR, live fluorescence imaging, three-dimensional reconstruction imaging, continuous time-lapse microscopic observation, flow cytometric analysis and immunoelectron microscopy. Isolated homogeneic mitochondria were transferred into human uterine endometrial gland-derived mesenchymal cells in a dose-dependent manner. Moreover, mitochondrial transfer rescued the mitochondrial respiratory function and improved the cellular viability in mitochondrial DNA-depleted cells and these effects lasted several days.

Our in vitro and in vivo studies established that autologous mitochondria are internalized into cardiomyocytes following transplantation; however, the mechanism(s) modulating internalization of these organelles were unknown. Here, we show that internalization of mitochondria occurs through actin-dependent endocytosis and rescues cell function by increasing ATP content and oxygen consumption rates. We also show that internalized mitochondria replace depleted mitochondrial (mt)DNA. These results describe the mechanism for internalization of mitochondria within host cells and provide a basis for novel therapeutic interventions allowing for the rescue and replacement of damaged or impaired mitochondria.",5,4

A molecular-based knowledge of endocytosis, including macropinocytosis and endosomal escape involving bacteria and viruses, could provide mechanistic insights into exogeneous mitochondrial transfer.

Alterations in cancer cell energy metabolism are linked to abnormalities in mitochondrial function. Mitochondrial dysfunction of cancer cells includes increased glycolysis, decreased apoptosis, and resistance to radiotherapy. The study was designed for two main points: firstly, to investigate whether exogenous functional mitochondria can transfer into glioma cells and explore the underlying molecular mechanisms from the perspective of endocytosis; secondly, to further verify whether the mitochondrial transplantation is able to rescue aerobic respiration, attenuate the Warburg effect and enhance the radiosensitivity of gliomas. Methods: Mitochondria were isolated from normal human astrocytes (HA) and immediately co-incubated with starved human glioma cells (U87). Confocal microscopy and gene sequencing were performed to evaluate the ability of isolated mitochondria internalization into U87 cells. The interaction between endocytosis and isolated mitochondria transfer were captured by 3D tomographic microscopy and transmission electron microscopy. NAD+, CD38, cADPR and Ca2+ release were determined by commercial kits, western blot, HLPC-MS and Fluo-3 AM respectively. PCR array expression profiling and Seahorse XF analysis were used to evaluate the effect of mitochondrial transplantation on energy phenotypes of U87 cells. U87 cells and U87 xenografts were both treated with mitochondrial transplantation, radiation, or a combination of mitochondrial transplantation and radiation. Apoptosis in vitro and in vivo were detected by cytochrome C, cleaved caspase 9 and TUNEL staining. Results: We found that mitochondria from HA could be transferred into starved U87 cells by simple co-incubation. Starvation treatment slowed the rate of glycolysis and decreased the transformation of NAD+ to NADH in U87 cells. A large amount of accumulated NAD+ was released into the extracellular space. CD38 is a member of the NAD+ glycohydrolase family that catalyzes the cyclization of extracellular NAD+ to intracellular cADPR. cADPR triggered release of Ca2+ to promote cytoskeleton remodeling and plasma membrane invagination. Thus, endocytosis involving isolated mitochondria internalization was mediated by NAD+-CD38-cADPR-Ca2+ signaling. Mitochondrial transfer enhanced gene and protein expression related to the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, increased aerobic respiration, attenuated glycolysis, reactivated the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway, inhibited malignant proliferation of U87 cells. Isolated mitochondria injected into U87 xenograft tumors also entered cells, and inhibited glioma growth in nude mice. Mitochondrial transplantation could enhance the radiosensitivity of gliomas in vitro and in vivo. Conclusion: These findings suggested that starvation-induced endocytosis via NAD+-CD38-cADPR-Ca2+ signaling could be a new mechanism of mitochondrial transplantation to rescue aerobic respiration and attenuate the Warburg effect. This mechanism could be a promising approach for radiosensitization.",12,9,3595-3607,eng

The latter study has suggested that Bcl-2 might protect cells from apoptosis by altering mitochondrial function and that mitochondria may be involved in apoptosis9,11.

We characterized mitochondrial distribution in these cells using confocal microscopy and evaluated the level of proteins directly involved in the mitochondrial dynamics and their regulation. We found that the organization of mitochondria within the cell is correlated with changes in the levels of proteins involved in mitochondrial dynamics and proteins responsible for regulation of this process. Induction of the autophagy/mitophagy process, which is crucial for cellular homeostasis under stress conditions was also shown.

This study aims to explore the role of mitochondrial genomic variations in ischemic stroke, and to uncover the nuclear genes involved in this relationship. Eight hundred and thirty Taiwanese patients with a history of ischemic stroke and 966 normal controls were genotyped for their mitochondrial haplogroup (Mthapg). Cytoplasmic hybrid cells (cybrids) harboring different Mthapgs were used to observe functional differences under hypoxia-ischemia. RNA sequencing (RNASeq) was conducted to identify the particularly elevated mRNA. The patient study identified an association between Mthapg F1 and risk of ischemic stroke (OR 1.72:1.27–2.34, p = 0.001). The cellular study further demonstrated an impeded induction of hypoxic inducible factor 1α in the Mthapg F1 cybrid after hypoxia-ischemia. Additionally, the study demonstrated that Mthapg F cybrids were associated with an altered mitochondrial function, including decreased oxygen consumption, higher mitochondrial ROS production, and lower mitochondrial membrane potential. Mthapg F cybrids were also noted to be prone to inflammation, with increased expression of several inflammatory cytokines and elevated matrix metalloproteinase 9. The RNASeq identified significantly elevated expressions of angiopoietin-like 4 in Mthapg F1 cybrids after hypoxia-ischemia.

A key role in this stage is played by mitochondria, which have recently emerged as highly interconnected and multifunctional hubs that process and coordinate diverse cellular functions. Beyond producing ATP, mitochondria generate key metabolites and are central to apoptotic and metabolic signaling pathways. Because most mitochondrial proteins are encoded in the nuclear genome, the biogenesis of new mitochondria and the maintenance of mitochondrial functions and flexibility critically depend upon effective mitonuclear communication. This review addresses the complex network of signaling molecules and pathways allowing mitochondria-nuclear communication and coordinated regulation of their independent but interconnected genomes, and discusses the extent to which dynamic communication between the two organelles has evolved for mutual benefit and for the overall maintenance of cellular and organismal fitness."

Mitochondrial transplantation replaces damaged mitochondria and enhances myocardial function and tissue viability. Herein we investigated the efficacy of mitochondrial transplantation in enhancing graft function and viability after prolonged CIT. METHODS Heterotopic heart transplantation was performed in C57BL/6J mice. Upon heart harvesting from C57BL/6J donors, 0.5 ml of either mitochondria (1 × 108 in respiration buffer; mitochondria group) or respiration buffer (vehicle group) was delivered antegrade to the coronary arteries via injection to the coronary ostium. The hearts were excised and preserved for 29 ± 0.3 hours in cold saline (4°C). The hearts were then heterotopically transplanted. A second injection of either mitochondria (1 × 108) or respiration buffer (vehicle) was delivered antegrade to the coronary arteries 5 minutes after transplantation. Grafts were analyzed for 24 hours. Beating score, graft function, and tissue injury were measured. RESULTS Beating score, calculated ejection fraction, and shortening fraction were significantly enhanced (p < 0.05), whereas necrosis and neutrophil infiltration were significantly decreased (p < 0.05) in the mitochondria group as compared with the vehicle group at 24 hours of reperfusion. Transmission electron microscopy showed the presence of contraction bands in vehicle but not in mitochondria grafts. CONCLUSIONS Mitochondrial transplantation prolongs CIT to 29 hours in the murine heart transplantation model, significantly enhances graft function, and decreases graft tissue injury. Mitochondrial transplantation may provide a means to reduce graft failure and improve transplantation outcomes after prolonged CIT.",1,38,92-99,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30391192

Johnston,Nick S.

The role of metabolism, and particularly of mitochondria, is increasingly being recognized as an important explanatory factor in cell-to-cell heterogeneity. Most eukaryotic cells possess a population of mitochondria, in the sense that mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) is held in multiple copies per cell, where the sequence of each molecule can vary. Hence, intra-cellular mitochondrial heterogeneity is possible, which can induce inter-cellular mitochondrial heterogeneity, and may drive aspects of cellular noise. In this review, we discuss sources of mitochondrial heterogeneity (variations between mitochondria in the same cell, and mitochondrial variations between supposedly identical cells) from both genetic and non-genetic perspectives, and mitochondrial genotype-phenotype links. We discuss the apparent homeostasis of mtDNA copy number, the observation of pervasive intra-cellular mtDNA mutation (which is termed “microheteroplasmy”), and developments in the understanding of inter-cellular mtDNA mutation (“macroheteroplasmy”). We point to the relationship between mitochondrial supercomplexes, cristal structure, pH, and cardiolipin as a potential amplifier of the mitochondrial genotype-phenotype link. We also discuss mitochondrial membrane potential and networks as sources of mitochondrial heterogeneity, and their influence upon the mitochondrial genome. Finally, we revisit the idea of mitochondrial complementation as a means of dampening mitochondrial genotype-phenotype links in light of recent experimental developments. The diverse sources of mitochondrial heterogeneity, as well as their increasingly recognized role in contributing to cellular heterogeneity, highlights the need for future single-cell mitochondrial measurements in the context of cellular noise studies.",,9,718

Ordinal methods for mitochondrial heteroplasmy cannot discriminate between an intercellular homogenic population composed of cells with similar intracellular heterogeneity for mtDNA and an intercellular heterogenic population composed of cells with different rates of mutated mtDNA. A high-throughput method to determine mitochondrial heteroplasmy in a single cell was developed by using droplet digital PCR with TaqMan polymerase in this study. This technique revealed that there are three different cell populations of cultured fibroblasts derived from patients with mitochondrial disease carrying a mutation in the mtDNA; cells with homoplasmy of either mutated or healthy mtDNA; and cells mixed with mutated and healthy mtDNA. The presence of intercellular heterogeneity, even in uniformed cultured fibroblasts, suggests that heterogeneity should exist among different kinds of cells. The diagnosis of intercellular heterogeneity with respect to mitochondrial heteroplasmy by this methodology could provide novel insight into developing a treatment strategy for mitochondrial diseases.",1,10

Hence, its functionality is highly dependent on mitochondrial activity and integrity. Therefore, mitochondria play a vital homeostatic role in neurons physiology and mitochondrial dysfunction implications have been reported in a variety of nervous system diseases including acute ischemia stroke. In an attempt to investigate and introduce a novel potential therapeutic strategy for AIS, we isolated healthy mitochondria from human umbilical cord derived mesenchymal stem cells (hUC-MSCs) followed by their intracerebroventricular transplantation in a rat model of ischemia, i.e. middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). Here we report that the mitochondrial transplantation ameliorated the reperfusion/ischemia-induced damages as reflected by declined blood creatine phosphokinase level, abolished apoptosis, decreased astroglyosis and microglia activation, reduced infarct size, and improved motor function.

Head",Breast Cancer Research and Treatment,,,Breast Cancer Res Tr,0167-6806,"Mitochondrial dysfunction of cancer cells includes increased aerobic glycolysis, elevated levels of ROS, decreased apoptosis, and resistance to chemotherapeutic agents. We hypothesized that the introduction of normal mitochondria into cancer cells might restore mitochondrial function and inhibit cancer cell growth, and reverse chemoresistance. First, in the present study, we tested if mitochondria of immortalized, untransformed mammary epithelial MCF-12A cells could enter into human cancer cell lines. Second, if introducing normal mitochondria into cancer cells would inhibit proliferation. And third, would the addition of normal mitochondria increase the sensitivity of human breast cancer MCF-7 cells to chemotherapy. We found that JC-1-stained mitochondria of immortalized, untransformed mammary epithelial MCF-12A cells can enter into the cancer cell lines MCF-7, MDA-MB-231, and NCI/ADR-Res, but cannot enter immortalized, untransformed MCF-12A cells. The normal mitochondria from immortalized, untransformed MCF-12A cells suppressed the proliferation of MCF-7 and NCI/ADR-Res cells in a dose-dependent pattern, but did not affect the proliferation of immortalized, untransformed MCF-12A cells. The normal mitochondria from immortalized, untransformed MCF-12A cells increased the sensitivity of human breast cancer MCF-7 cells to doxorubicin, Abraxane, and carboplatin. In conclusion, the introduction of normal mammary mitochondria into human breast cancer cells inhibits cancer cell proliferation and increases the sensitivity of the MCF-7 human breast cancer cell line to doxorubicin, Abraxane, and carboplatin. These results support the role of mitochondrial dysfunction in cancer and suggest the possible use of targeted mitochondria for cancer therapeutics.",2,136,347-354

However, the precise role of mitochondria in cancer is controversial. Hence, here we tried to further clarify the role of mitochondria in cancer by transferring healthy mitochondria to cancer cells, and also to cells with depleted mitochondrial DNA (ρ0). Healthy mitochondria were isolated from WI-38 cells and were transferred to HeLa, SAS, HeLa ρ0, and SAS ρ0 cells. Then, cell proliferation was verified. In addition, the cells were treated by different concentrations of cisplatin and assessed for apoptosis induction and quantifying the mRNA expression of apoptosis-related genes. Results revealed that incubation of the HeLa, SAS and HeLa ρ0 cells with 5 µg/ml of the isolated mitochondria for 24 h significantly (p < 0.001) increased cell proliferation compared to non-treated controls. Interestingly, the mitochondria transfer rescued the ρ0 cells and made them capable of growing under conventional culture medium. However, the number of apoptotic cells was significantly higher in the HeLa ρ0 cells that received the mitochondria (HeLa-Fibro-Mit) compared to the HeLa ρ0. Furthermore, the expression level of BCL-2 anti-apoptotic gene was down-regulated in both HeLa-Fibro-Mit and SAS-Fibro-Mit cell lines while the expression levels of the BAX, caspase8, caspase9, and AIF pro-apoptotic genes were upregulated.

Creighton,Wai-Yee Chan,Lee-Jun C. Wong",PLoS ONE,,,,,"Mitochondrial-nucleus cross talks and mitochondrial retrograde regulation can play a significant role in cellular properties. Transmitochondrial cybrid systems (cybrids) are an excellent tool to study specific effects of altered mitochondria under a defined nuclear background. The majority of the studies using the cybrid model focused on the significance of specific mitochondrial DNA variations in mitochondrial function or tumor properties. However, most of these variants are benign polymorphisms without known functional significance. From an objective of rectifying mitochondrial defects in cancer cells and to establish mitochondria as a potential anticancer drug target, understanding the role of functional mitochondria in reversing oncogenic properties under a cancer nuclear background is very important. Here we analyzed the potential reversal of oncogenic properties of a highly metastatic cell line with the introduction of non-cancerous mitochondria. Cybrids were established by fusing the mitochondria DNA depleted 143B TK- ρ0 cells from an aggressive osteosarcoma cell line with mitochondria from benign breast epithelial cell line MCF10A, moderately metastatic breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-468 and 143B cells. In spite of the uniform cancerous nuclear background, as observed with the mitochondria donor cells, cybrids with benign mitochondria showed high mitochondrial functional properties including increased ATP synthesis, oxygen consumption and respiratory chain activities compared to cybrids with cancerous mitochondria. Interestingly, benign mitochondria could reverse different oncogenic characteristics of 143B TK- cell including cell proliferation, viability under hypoxic condition, anti-apoptotic properties, resistance to anti-cancer drug, invasion, and colony formation in soft agar, and in vivo tumor growth in nude mice. Microarray analysis suggested that several oncogenic pathways observed in cybrids with cancer mitochondria are inhibited in cybrids with non-cancerous mitochondria. These results suggest the critical oncogenic regulation by mitochondrial-nuclear cross talk and highlights rectifying mitochondrial functional properties as a promising target in cancer therapy.",5,8

Sonication was shown to be a rapid and sensitive isolation method. Yields of 14.0 ± 0.3 mg raw mitochondrial protein per 108 cells were obtained. The mitochondria were morphologically intact, with membrane integrities of 67% (outer membrane) to 94% (inner membrane). Compared with the methods using Dounce homogenization, digitonin permeabilization, or electroporation for cell disruption the ultrasound method provided the highest yield of isolated mitochondria. Furthermore, this method is rapid (≈ 45 s for disruption), more robust than Dounce homogenization regarding their influence on mitochondrial integrity and especially suitable for preparing a relatively large amount of mitochondria.

As an organelle, the mitochondrion has been a popular subject for proteomic analysis, but quantitative proteomic methods have yet to be applied to tease apart subtle differences among mitochondria from different tissues or muscle types. Here we used mass spectrometry-based proteomics to analyze mitochondrial proteins extracted from rat skeletal muscle, heart, and liver tissues. Based on 689 proteins identified with high confidence, mitochondria from the different tissues are qualitatively quite similar. However, striking differences emerged from the quantitative comparison of protein abundance between the tissues. Furthermore we applied similar methods to analyze mitochondrial matrix and intermembrane space proteins extracted from the same mitochondrial source, providing evidence for the submitochondrial localization of a number of proteins in skeletal muscle and liver. Several proteins not previously thought to reside in mitochondria were identified, and their presence in this organelle was confirmed by protein correlation profiling. Hierarchical clustering of microarray expression data provided further evidence that some of the novel mitochondrial candidates identified in the proteomic survey might be associated with mitochondria. These data reveal several important distinctions between mitochondrial and submitochondrial proteomes from skeletal muscle, heart, and liver tissue sources. Indeed approximately one-third of the proteins identified in the soluble fractions are associated predominantly to one of the three tissues, indicating a tissue-dependent regulation of mitochondrial proteins. Furthermore a small percentage of the mitochondrial proteome is unique to each tissue.",4,5,608-19,eng

Cowan",Clinical and Translational Medicine,,,Clin Transl Medicine,2001-1326,"Mitochondria play a key role in the homeostasis of the vast majority of the body’s cells. In the myocardium where mitochondria constitute 30 % of the total myocardial cell volume, temporary attenuation or obstruction of blood flow and as a result oxygen delivery to myocardial cells (ischemia) severely alters mitochondrial structure and function. These alterations in mitochondrial structure and function occur during ischemia and continue after blood flow and oxygen delivery to the myocardium is restored, and significantly decrease myocardial contractile function and myocardial cell survival. We hypothesized that the augmentation or replacement of mitochondria damaged by ischemia would provide a mechanism to enhance cellular function and cellular rescue following the restoration of blood flow. To test this hypothesis we have used a model of myocardial ischemia and reperfusion. Our studies demonstrate that the transplantation of autologous mitochondria, isolated from the patient’s own body, and then directly injected into the myocardial during early reperfusion augment the function of native mitochondria damaged during ischemia and enhances myocardial post-ischemic functional recovery and cellular viability. The transplanted mitochondria act both extracellularly and intracellularly. Extracellularly, the transplanted mitochondria enhance high energy synthesis and cellular adenosine triphosphate stores and alter the myocardial proteome. Once internalized the transplanted mitochondria rescue cellular function and replace damaged mitochondrial DNA. There is no immune or auto-immune reaction and there is no pro-arrhythmia as a result of the transplanted mitochondria. Our studies and those of others demonstrate that mitochondrial transplantation can be effective in a number of cell types and diseases. These include cardiac and skeletal muscle, pulmonary and hepatic tissue and cells and in neuronal tissue. In this review we discuss the mechanisms leading to mitochondrial dysfunction and the effects on cellular function. We provide a methodology for the isolation of mitochondria to allow for clinical relevance and we discuss the methods we and others have used for the uptake and internalization of mitochondria. We foresee that mitochondrial transplantation will be a valued treatment in the armamentarium of all clinicians and surgeons for the treatment of varied ischemic disorders, mitochondrial diseases and related disorders.",1,5,16

Pasala,Aishwarya Prakash",Environmental and Molecular Mutagenesis,,,Environ Mol Mutagen,0893-6692,"Maintenance of the mitochondrial genome is essential for proper cellular function. For this purpose, mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) needs to be faithfully replicated, transcribed, translated, and repaired in the face of constant onslaught from endogenous and environmental agents. Although only 13 polypeptides are encoded within mtDNA, the mitochondrial proteome comprises over 1500 proteins that are encoded by nuclear genes and translocated to the mitochondria for the purpose of maintaining mitochondrial function. Regulation of mtDNA and mitochondrial proteins by epigenetic changes and post‐translational modifications facilitate crosstalk between the nucleus and the mitochondria and ultimately lead to the maintenance of cellular health and homeostasis. DNA methyl transferases have been identified in the mitochondria implicating that methylation occurs within this organelle; however, the extent to which mtDNA is methylated has been debated for many years. Mechanisms of demethylation within this organelle have also been postulated, but the exact mechanisms and their outcomes is still an active area of research. Mitochondrial dysfunction in the form of altered gene expression and ATP production, resulting from epigenetic changes, can lead to various conditions including aging‐related neurodegenerative disorders, altered metabolism, changes in circadian rhythm, and cancer. Here, we provide an overview of the epigenetic regulation of mtDNA via methylation, long and short noncoding RNAs, and post‐translational modifications of nucleoid proteins (as mitochondria lack histones). We also highlight the influence of xenobiotics such as airborne environmental pollutants, contamination from heavy metals, and therapeutic drugs on mtDNA methylation. Environ. Mol.

This plasticity enables the mitochondria to undergo morphological and functional changes in response to cellular demands. Stem cells also need to remain functionally plastic (i.e. to have the ability to “decide” whether to remain quiescent or to undergo activation upon signaling cues to support tissue function and homeostasis). Mitochondrial plasticity is thought to enable this reshaping of stem cell functions, integrating signaling cues with stem cell outcomes. Indeed, recent evidence highlights the crucial role of maintaining mitochondrial plasticity for stem cell biology. For example, tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle metabolites generated and metabolized in the mitochondria serve as cofactors for epigenetic enzymes, thereby coupling mitochondrial metabolism and transcriptional regulation. Another layer of mitochondrial plasticity has emerged, pointing toward mitochondrial dynamics in regulating stem cell fate decisions. Imposing imbalanced mitochondrial dynamics by manipulating the expression levels of the key molecular regulators of this process influences cellular outcomes by changing the nuclear transcriptional program. Moreover, reactive oxygen species have also been shown to play an important role in regulating transcriptional profiles in stem cells.

Previous studies documented multiple biochemical changes in recipient cells shortly after mtDNA transfer, but the long-term retention and function of transferred mtDNA remains unknown. Here, we evaluate mtDNA retention in new host cells using ‘MitoPunch’, a device that transfers isolated mitochondria into mouse and human cells. We show that newly introduced mtDNA is stably retained in mtDNA-deficient (ρ0) recipient cells following uridine-free selection, although exogenous mtDNA is lost from metabolically impaired, mtDNA-intact (ρ+) cells. We then introduced a second selective pressure by transferring chloramphenicol-resistant mitochondria into chloramphenicol-sensitive, metabolically impaired ρ+ mouse cybrid cells. Following double selection, recipient cells with mismatched nuclear (nDNA) and mitochondrial (mtDNA) genomes retained transferred mtDNA, which replaced the endogenous mutant mtDNA and improved cell respiration. However, recipient cells with matched mtDNA-nDNA failed to retain transferred mtDNA and sustained impaired respiration. Our results suggest that exogenous mtDNA retention in metabolically impaired ρ+ recipients depends on the degree of recipient mtDNA-nDNA co-evolution. Uncovering factors that stabilize exogenous mtDNA integration will improve our understanding of in vivo mitochondrial transfer and the interplay between mitochondrial and nuclear genomes.",1,10,14328

Question would be what kind of pathways are these inactive mitochondria part-taking in? (e.g. lipogenesis and FA metabolics)
I can apply this to my iPSC project by finding what types of metabolites are overexpressed in iPSCs and seeing if their presensce shifts when I add active mitochondria primed for cardiomyocyte function. This would be an interesting result, as mitotransplant could affect the endogenous population that might be more succeptible to metabolic shifting.

So I could do a study into these metabolic shifts, also observe shifts in mitochondrial phenotype (I would assume iPSC mitos are mostly inactive, low JC-1, while Cardiomyocytes are active, high JC-1).

Interestingly, both the processes of differentiation and dedifferentiation witness a drastic and dynamic alteration in the morphology, number, distribution, and respiratory capacity of mitochondria, which are tightly regulated by the fission/fusion cycle, and mitochondrial clearance through autophagy following mitochondrial fission. Intriguingly, mitophagy is said to be essential in the differentiation of stem cells into various lineages such as erythrocytes, eye lenses, neurites, myotubes, and M1 macrophages. Mitophagy is also believed to play a central role in the dedifferentiation of a terminally differentiated cell into an induced pluripotent cell and in the acquisition of ‘stemness’ in cancer cells. Mitophagy-induced alteration in the mitochondrial dynamics facilitates metabolic shift, either into a glycolytic phenotype or into an OXPHOS phenotype, depending on the cellular demand. Mitophagy-induced rejuvenation of mitochondria regulates the transition of bioenergetics and metabolome, remodeling which facilitates an alteration in their cellular developmental capability. This review describes the detailed mechanism of the process of mitophagy and its association with cellular programming through alteration in the mitochondrial energetics.

Struys,Mirjam Wamelink,Hans Lehrach,Markus Ralser,Bernd Timmermann,James Adjaye",STEM CELLS,,,Stem Cells,1549-4918,"Human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) have been recently found to harbor genomic alterations. However, the integrity of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) within reprogrammed cells has yet to be investigated. mtDNA mutations occur at a high rate and contribute to the pathology of a number of human disorders. Furthermore, the lack of mtDNA integrity may alter cellular bioenergetics and limit efficient differentiation. We demonstrated previously that the derivation of iPSCs is associated with mitochondrial remodeling and a metabolic switch towards glycolysis. Here, we have discovered that alterations of mtDNA can occur upon the induction of pluripotency. Massively parallel pyrosequencing of mtDNA revealed that human iPSCs derived from young healthy donors harbored single base mtDNA mutations (substitutions, insertions, and deletions), both homoplasmic (in all mtDNA molecules) and heteroplasmic (in a fraction of mtDNAs), not present in the parental cells. mtDNA modifications were mostly common variants and not disease related. Moreover, iPSC lines bearing different mtDNA mutational loads maintained a consistent human embryonic stem cell–like reprogramming of energy metabolism. This involved the upregulation of glycolytic enzymes, increased glucose-6-phosphate levels, and the over-expression of pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 1 protein, which reroutes the bioenergetic flux toward glycolysis. Hence, mtDNA mutations within iPSCs may not necessarily impair the correct establishment of pluripotency and the associated metabolic reprogramming. Nonetheless, the occurrence of pathogenic mtDNA modifications might be an important aspect to monitor when characterizing iPSC lines. Finally, we speculate that this random rearrangement of mtDNA molecules might prove beneficial for the derivation of mutation-free iPSCs from patients with mtDNA disorders.

We compared the energy metabolism of hESCs, IPSCs, and their somatic counterparts. Focusing on mitochondria, we tracked organelle localization and morphology. Furthermore we performed gene expression analysis of several pathways related to the glucose metabolism, including glycolysis, the pentose phosphate pathway and the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. In addition we determined oxygen consumption rates (OCR) using a metabolic extracellular flux analyzer, as well as total intracellular ATP levels by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Finally we explored the expression of key proteins involved in the regulation of glucose metabolism. Our results demonstrate that, although the metabolic signature of IPSCs is not identical to that of hESCs, nonetheless they cluster with hESCs rather than with their somatic counterparts. ATP levels, lactate production and OCR revealed that human pluripotent cells rely mostly on glycolysis to meet their energy demands.

Although methods to differentiate iPSCs into beating cardiomyocytes (iPSC-CMs) have recently been adequately optimized and commercialized, the resulting cells remain largely immature with regards to their structure and function, demonstrating fetal gene expression, disorganized morphology, reliance on predominantly glycolytic metabolism and contractile characteristics that differ from those of adult cardiomyocytes.

To realize hESC/hiPSC-based cardiac cell therapy, efficient induction, purification, and transplantation methods for cardiomyocytes are required. Though marker gene transduction or fluorescent-based purification methods have been reported, fast, efficient and scalable purification methods with no genetic modification are essential for clinical purpose but have not yet been established. In this study, we attempted to identify cell surface markers for cardiomyocytes derived from hESC/hiPSCs. We adopted a previously reported differentiation protocol for hESCs based on high density monolayer culture to hiPSCs with some modification. Cardiac troponin-T (TNNT2)-positive cardiomyocytes appeared robustly with 30–70% efficiency. Using this differentiation method, we screened 242 antibodies for human cell surface molecules to isolate cardiomyocytes derived from hiPSCs and identified anti-VCAM1 (Vascular cell adhesion molecule 1) antibody specifically marked cardiomyocytes. TNNT2-positive cells were detected at day 7–8 after induction and 80% of them became VCAM1-positive by day 11. Approximately 95–98% of VCAM1-positive cells at day 11 were positive for TNNT2. VCAM1 was exclusive with CD144 (endothelium), CD140b (pericytes) and TRA-1-60 (undifferentiated hESCs/hiPSCs). 95% of MACS-purified cells were positive for TNNT2. MACS purification yielded 5−10×105 VCAM1-positive cells from a single well of a six-well culture plate. Purified VCAM1-positive cells displayed molecular and functional features of cardiomyocytes. VCAM1 also specifically marked cardiomyocytes derived from other hESC or hiPSC lines. We succeeded in efficiently inducing cardiomyocytes from hESCs/hiPSCs and identifying VCAM1 as a potent cell surface marker for robust, efficient and scalable purification of cardiomyocytes from hESC/hiPSCs. These findings would offer a valuable technological basis for hESC/hiPSC-based cell therapy.",8,6,e23657

In general, researchers consider that the cardiac cells are derived from the same origin as mesodermal cells, except neural crest cells. However, as the developmental stages proceed, cardiac mesodermal cells are differentiated into various types of cells via cardiac progenitors and demonstrate different programming in transcriptional network and epigenetic regulation in a spatiotemporal manner. In fact, the metabolic feature also changes dramatically during heart development and cardiac differentiation. Researchers reported that each type of cell exhibits different metabolic features that can be used to specifically identify them. Metabolism is a critical process for generating energy and biomass in all living cells and organisms and has been long regarded as a passenger, rather than an active driver, for intracellular status. However, recent studies revealed that metabolism influences self-renewal and cell fate specification via epigenetic changes directly or indirectly. Metabolism mirrors the physiological status of the cell and endogenous cellular activity; therefore, understanding the metabolic signature of each cell type serves as a guide for innovative methods of selecting and differentiating desired cell types. Stem cell biology and developmental biology hold great promise for cardiac regenerative therapy, for which, successful strategy depends on the precise translation of the philosophy of cardiac development in the early embryo to the cell production system.

Reprogramming entails multiple transgene integrations and occurs apparently stochastically in rare cells over many days. Tissue stem cells may be subject to less-stringent epigenetic restrictions than other cells and might therefore be more amenable to deprogramming. We report that brain-derived neural stem (NS) cells acquire undifferentiated morphology rapidly and at high frequency after a single round of transduction with reprogramming factors. However, critical attributes of true pluripotency—including stable expression of endogenous Oct4 and Nanog, epigenetic erasure of X chromosome silencing in female cells, and ability to colonise chimaeras—were not attained. We therefore applied molecularly defined conditions for the derivation and propagation of authentic pluripotent stem cells from embryos. We combined dual inhibition (2i) of mitogen-activated protein kinase signalling and glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK3) with the self-renewal cytokine leukaemia inhibitory factor (LIF). The 2i/LIF condition induced stable up-regulation of Oct4 and Nanog, reactivation of the X chromosome, transgene silencing, and competence for somatic and germline chimaerism. Using 2i /LIF, NS cell reprogramming required only 1–2 integrations of each transgene. Furthermore, transduction with Sox2 and c-Myc is dispensable, and Oct4 and Klf4 are sufficient to convert NS cells into chimaera-forming iPS cells. These findings demonstrate that somatic cell state influences requirements for reprogramming and delineate two phases in the process. The ability to capture pre-pluripotent cells that can advance to ground state pluripotency simply and with high efficiency opens a door to molecular dissection of this remarkable phenomenon.",10,6,e253

While it is widely accepted that the coordination of genetic circuits with developmental bioenergetics is critical to phenotype specification, the metabolic mechanisms that drive cardiac transformation are largely unknown. Here, we aim to define the energetic requirements for and the metabolic microenvironment needed to support the cardiac differentiation of embryonic stem cells. We demonstrate that anaerobic glycolytic metabolism, while sufficient for embryonic stem cell homeostasis, must be transformed into the more efficient mitochondrial oxidative metabolism to secure cardiac specification and excitation-contraction coupling. This energetic switch was programmed by rearrangement of the metabolic transcriptome that encodes components of glycolysis, fatty acid oxidation, the Krebs cycle, and the electron transport chain. Modifying the copy number of regulators of mitochondrial fusion and fission resulted in mitochondrial maturation and network expansion, which in turn provided an energetic continuum to supply nascent sarcomeres. Disrupting respiratory chain function prevented mitochondrial organization and compromised the energetic infrastructure, causing deficient sarcomerogenesis and contractile malfunction. Thus, establishment of the mitochondrial system and engagement of oxidative metabolism are prerequisites for the differentiation of stem cells into a functional cardiac phenotype.

In recent years, significant advances have been made in using these cells to obtain large numbers of cardiomyocyte (CM) -like cells for scientific research and clinical application. A vast number of protocols have emerged describing differentiation methods without the use of animal serum or extracts restrictive for use in a human clinical setting. These techniques follow a complicated procedure, which although successful, show a relatively varied yield among cell batches. Results: We have designed a three-step differentiation protocol using defined reagents and a monolayer culture without feeder cells, avoiding embryoid body formation and multiple trypsin treatment, in which beating foci appeared as early as day 6 in in vitro differentiating conditions. Our results show a high yield of CM reaching approximately 60% of the differentiated cells after 13 days in vitro. Conclusions: We provide a fast, simple, reliable and reproducible protocol for inducing murine ES cells toward a CM-like phenotype comparable to available high-yield protocols, without the use of intermediate trypsinization/passage steps.

Media consisted of modified tissue culture medium 199 (mTCM 199) with ovine LH (oLH) for maturation (IVM), experimental alterations of modified defined medium (mDM) for sperm selection and insemination (IVF), and citrate+synthetic oviductal fluid+nonessential amino acids (c-SOF+NEA) for zygote/embryo culture (IVC). Effects of heparin, BSA, polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), penicillamine (P), Hepes, and sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3) were studied. Results included proportions of oocytes that cleaved by 48 h and that reached morulae by 120 h, blastocysts by 168 h, and expanded blastocysts by 216 h postinsemination (pi). Best results were obtained when the IVF medium included 0.5 mg P+1.0 mg PVA per milliliter with no more than 10 mM Hepes, and when 3.0 mg PVA/ml and 10 mM Hepes were present for IVC. Different concentrations of NaHCO3, up to 50 mM from 25 mM, during IVF did not alter results. Embryos produced in defined conditions yielding the best results remained viable after vitrification as evidenced by continued development in vitro for 96 h postthawing. Bovine oocytes matured in defined medium supplemented with LH were fertilized and cultured up to the blastocyst stage in chemically defined conditions that afforded results comparable to those reported earlier after inclusion of serum, BSA, and/or somatic cells.",2,55,333-339

However, the exact mechanisms regulating these phenotypes remain poorly understood. Here, we show the critical role of mitochondria in cellular senescence. In multiple models of senescence, absence of mitochondria reduced a spectrum of senescence effectors and phenotypes while preserving ATP production via enhanced glycolysis. Global transcriptomic analysis by RNA sequencing revealed that a vast number of senescent‐associated changes are dependent on mitochondria, particularly the pro‐inflammatory phenotype. Mechanistically, we show that the ATM, Akt and mTORC1 phosphorylation cascade integrates signals from the DNA damage response (DDR) towards PGC‐1β‐dependent mitochondrial biogenesis, contributing to a ROS‐mediated activation of the DDR and cell cycle arrest. Finally, we demonstrate that the reduction in mitochondrial content in vivo, by either mTORC1 inhibition or PGC‐1β deletion, prevents senescence in the ageing mouse liver. Our results suggest that mitochondria are a candidate target for interventions to reduce the deleterious impact of senescence in ageing tissues.",7,35,724-742

However, induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) retain transcriptional memory, epigenetic memory, and metabolic memory from their somatic cells of origin and acquire aberrant characteristics distinct from either other pluripotent cells or parental cells, reflecting incomplete reprogramming. As a critical link between the microenvironment and regulation of the epigenome, nutrient availability likely plays a significant role in the retention of somatic cell memory by iPSC. Significantly, relative nutrient availability impacts iPSC reprogramming efficiency, epigenetic regulation and cell fate, and differentially alters their ability to respond to physiological stimuli. The significance of metabolites during the reprogramming process is central to further elucidating how iPSC retain somatic cell characteristics and optimising culture conditions to generate iPSC with physiological phenotypes to ensure their reliable use in basic research and clinical applications. This review serves to integrate studies on iPSC reprogramming, memory retention and metabolism, and identifies areas in which current knowledge is limited.",,2019,1-10

Gardner,Alexandra J. Harvey",STEM CELLS,,,Stem Cells,1066-5099,"The transition to pluripotency invokes profound metabolic restructuring; however, reprogramming is accompanied by the retention of somatic cell metabolic and epigenetic memory. Modulation of metabolism during reprogramming has been shown to improve reprogramming efficiency, yet it is not known how metabolite availability during reprogramming affects the physiology of resultant induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). Metabolic analyses of iPSCs generated under either physiological (5%; P‐iPSC) or atmospheric (20%; A‐iPSC) oxygen conditions revealed that they retained aspects of somatic cell metabolic memory and failed to regulate carbohydrate metabolism with A‐iPSC acquiring different metabolic characteristics. A‐iPSC exhibited a higher mitochondrial membrane potential and were unable to modulate oxidative metabolism in response to oxygen challenge, contrasting with P‐iPSC. RNA‐seq analysis highlighted that A‐iPSC displayed transcriptomic instability and a reduction in telomere length. Consequently, inappropriate modulation of metabolism by atmospheric oxygen during reprogramming significantly impacts the resultant A‐iPSC metabolic and transcriptional landscape. Furthermore, retention of partial somatic metabolic memory in P‐iPSC derived under physiological oxygen suggests that metabolic reprogramming remains incomplete. As the metabolome is a regulator of the epigenome, these observed perturbations of iPSC metabolism will plausibly have downstream effects on cellular function and physiology, both during and following differentiation, and highlight the need to optimize nutrient availability during the reprogramming process. Stem Cells 2019;37:1042–1056 Using glycolytic metabolite quantification, bioenergetic profiling, and RNA‐seq, we demonstrate that reprogramming neonatal human dermal fibroblasts under atmospheric (20%) oxygen results in induced pluripotent stem cells with a compromised glycolytic profile, inadequately restructured mitochondrial metabolism, shortened telomeres, and transcriptomic instability.",8,37,1042-1056

We report a compendium of chemical-genetic interactions involving 191 distinct genetic modifiers, including 38 that are synthetic sick/lethal and 63 that are suppressors. Genes involved in glycolysis (PFKP), pentose phosphate pathway (G6PD), and defense against lipid peroxidation (GPX4) scored high as synthetic sick/lethal. A surprisingly large fraction of suppressors are pathway intrinsic and encode mitochondrial proteins. A striking example of such “intra-organelle” buffering is the alleviation of a chemical defect in complex V by simultaneous inhibition of complex I, which benefits cells by rebalancing redox cofactors, increasing reductive carboxylation, and promoting glycolysis. Perhaps paradoxically, certain forms of mitochondrial dysfunction may best be buffered with “second site” inhibitors to the organelle.",5,179

In this study, we found that ATP generation in spermatogonia was gradually increased upon retinoic acid (RA)-induced differentiation. To accommodate this elevated energy demand, RA signaling concomitantly switched ATP production in spermatogonia from glycolysis to mitochondrial respiration, accompanied by increased levels of reactive oxygen species. Disrupting mitochondrial respiration significantly blocked spermatogonial differentiation. Inhibition of glucose conversion to glucose-6-phosphate or pentose phosphate pathway also repressed the formation of c-Kit+ differentiating germ cells, suggesting that metabolites produced from glycolysis are required for spermatogonial differentiation.

Single-cell profiling shows that the mesenchymal blastema cells are distinct from both uninjured digit and embryonic limb or digit Pdgfra-positive cells. This unique blastema state is environmentally determined; dermal fibroblasts transplanted into the regenerative, but not non-regenerative, digit express blastema-state genes and contribute to bone regeneration. Moreover, lineage tracing with single-cell profiling indicates that endogenous osteoblasts or osteocytes acquire a blastema mesenchymal transcriptional state and contribute to both dermis and bone regeneration. Thus, mammalian digit tip regeneration occurs via a distinct adult mechanism where the regenerative environment promotes acquisition of a blastema state that enables cells from tissues such as bone to contribute to the regeneration of other mesenchymal tissues such as the dermis.",4,52

In mice, these cells instigate multiple aging-related features, including metabolic, cognitive, physical, and cardiovascular alterations, which together result in premature death. T cell metabolic failure induces the accumulation of circulating cytokines, which resembles the chronic inflammation that is characteristic of aging (“inflammaging”). This cytokine storm itself acts as a systemic inducer of senescence. Blocking tumor necrosis factor–α signaling or preventing senescence with nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide precursors partially rescues premature aging in mice with Tfam-deficient T cells. Thus, T cells can regulate organismal fitness and life span, which highlights the importance of tight immunometabolic control in both aging and the onset of age-associated diseases.",6497,368,1371-1376

Digit-tip regeneration in mice and humans is a remarkable example of mammalian organ regeneration. Nevertheless, this ability is very limited: digits never regenerate when amputated beyond the nail. Mayumi Ito and colleagues provide new insight into this process, by showing that the mechanisms governing nail stem cell differentiation in mice are directly coupled to their ability to orchestrate digit regeneration. Nail progenitors located distal to the nail stem cell region undergo differentiation into nail in a process dependent on Wnt signalling. Wnt signalling activation is also required for nail regeneration and for attracting nerves that promote regeneration of the entire digit after amputation. The authors suggest that nail stem cells might be used for developing new treatments for amputees. The tips of mammalian digits can regenerate after amputation1,2, like those of amphibians. It is unknown why this capacity is limited to the area associated with the nail2,3,4. Here we show that nail stem cells (NSCs) reside in the proximal nail matrix and that the mechanisms governing NSC differentiation are coupled directly with their ability to orchestrate digit regeneration.

Amputations proximal to the Wnt-active nail progenitors result in failure to regenerate the nail or digit. Nevertheless, β-catenin stabilization in the NSC region induced their regeneration.

In this study, we determined the expression and function of miR-590-3p in EOC. miR-590-3p levels were higher in high-grade carcinoma when compared with low-grade or tumors with low malignant potential. Interestingly, plasma levels of miR-590-3p were significantly higher in patients with EOC than in subjects with benign gynecologic disorders. Transient transfection of miR-590-3p mimics or stable transfection of mir-590 increased cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. In vivo studies revealed that mir-590 accelerated tumor growth and metastasis. Using a cDNA microarray, we identified forkhead box A2 (FOXA2) and versican (VCAN) as top downregulated and upregulated genes by mir-590, respectively. miR-590-3p targeted FOXA2 3' UTR to suppress its expression. In addition, knockdown or knockout of FOXA2 enhanced cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. Overexpression of FOXA2 decreased, whereas knockout of FOXA2 increased VCAN mRNA and protein levels, which was due to direct binding and regulation of the VCAN gene by FOXA2. Interrogation of the TCGA ovarian cancer database revealed a negative relationship between FOXA2 and VCAN mRNA levels in EOC tumors, and high FOXA2/low VCAN mRNA levels in tumors positively correlated with patient survival. Finally, overexpression of FOXA2 or silencing of VCAN reversed the effects of mir-590. These findings demonstrate that miR-590-3p promotes EOC development via a novel FOXA2-VCAN pathway.Significance: Low FOXA2/high VCAN levels mediate the tumor-promoting effects of miR-590-3p and negatively correlate with ovarian cancer survival.

Several studies have shown that various mechanisms are involved in mitochondrial transfer that includes tunnel tube formation, micro vesicle formation, gap junctions, cell fusion and others modes of transfer. Few studies have investigated the mechanisms that contribute to mitochondrial transfer, primarily comprising of signaling pathways involved in tunnel tube formation that facilitates tunnel tube formation for movement of mitochondria from one cell to another. Various stress signals such as release of damaged mitochondria, mtDNA and mitochondrial products along with elevated reactive oxygen species levels trigger the transfer of mitochondria from MSCs to recipient cells. However, extensive cell signaling pathways that lead to mitochondrial transfer from healthy cells are still under investigation and the changes that contribute to restoration of mitochondrial bioenergetics in recipient cells remain largely elusive.

By regulating nucleosome dynamics, remodelers gate access to the underlying DNA for replication, repair, and transcription. Nucleosomes are subject to extensive post-translational modifications that can recruit regulatory proteins or alter the local chromatin structure. Just as extensive crosstalk has been observed between different histone post-translational modifications, there is growing evidence for both coordinated and antagonistic functional relations between nucleosome remodeling and modifying machineries. Defining the combined functions of the complexes that alter nucleosome interactions, position, and stability is key to understanding processes that require access to DNA, particularly with growing appreciation of their contributions to human health and disease.

Page Haynes,Diviya Sinha,Emmanuelle Clerisme,Jeffrey R. Bender",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences,,,Proc National Acad Sci,0027-8424,"Estrogen induces both rapid and delayed effects on the cardiovascular system. The early effects take place within minutes (e.g., changes in vasomotor tone) and are mediated through rapid intracellular signaling pathways; whereas the delayed effects (e.g., remodeling or lipid alterations) require hours to days to occur and require transcriptional effects with subsequent modulation of protein expression. To study the acute effects of 17β-estradiol (E2) treatment on vascular function, we have investigated the rapid (on the order of minutes) effects of E2 treatment on intracellular signaling in human endothelial cells (EC). Our previous data have shown that E2 induces rapid release of NO from and activation of guanylate cyclase in human EC. In this study, we demonstrate that E2 also activates mitogen-activated protein kinase (extracellular signal-related kinase) signaling within minutes in EC. We hypothesized that this effect might be mediated by estrogen receptors (ER) localized to the cell surface. Our data show that membrane-impermeant forms of E2 also activate EC mitogen-activated protein kinase as well as stimulate cGMP production and NO release. The ER antagonist ICI 182,780 blocks this effect. Using confocal microscopy and flow cytometric analysis, we demonstrate that EC contain surface binding sites for E2, detectable by cell-impermeant ligand binding and equally with an anti-ERα antibody. Immunoreactive bands of 66 and 45 kDa are detectable with an anti-ERα mAb in human EC, and their individual presence correlates functionally with E2-stimulated genomic and rapid nongenomic responses, respectively. Membrane ERs may provide key molecular switches in these novel, rapid signaling pathways induced by E2 in EC.",11,97,5930-5935

Furthermore, mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) copy is strictly regulated during differentiation. Undifferentiated, pluripotent cells possess fewer than 300 copies of mtDNA, which establishes the mtDNA set point and promotes cell proliferation and, as a result, these cells rely on glycolysis with some support from oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) for the generation of ATP. The mtDNA set point provides the starting point from which cells increase their mtDNA copy number as they differentiate into mature functional cells. Dependent on cell types, mtDNA copy number ranges from ~10 copies in sperm to several thousand in cardiomyocytes. Consequently, differentiating cell types can acquire the appropriate numbers of mtDNA copy to meet their specific requirements for ATP generated through OXPHOS. However, as reprogrammed somatic cells do not always achieve this, it is essential to analyze them for their OXPHOS potential and ability to regulate mtDNA copy number. Here, we describe how to assess mtDNA copy number in pluripotent and differentiating cells using real-time PCR protocols; assess expression of the mtDNA specific replication factors through real-time RT-PCR; identify mtDNA variants in embryonic and induced pluripotent stem cells; determine DNA methylation patterns of the mtDNA-specific replication factors; and assess mitochondrial OXPHOS capacity.",,1330,219-252

Conceptual progress in the last decade has added two emerging hallmarks of potential generality to this list—reprogramming of energy metabolism and evading immune destruction.

Despite displaying key cardiomyocyte phenotypic characteristics, they more closely resemble fetal/neonatal cardiomyocytes and are still immature, these cells mainly rely on glucose as a substrate for metabolic energy, while mature cardiomyocytes mainly employ oxidative phosphorylation of fatty acids. Studies showed that the alteration of metabolism pattern from glycolysis to oxidative phosphorylation improve the maturity of hiPSC-CMs. As a transcription factor, accumulating evidences showed the important role of Nrf2 in the regulation of energy metabolism, which directly regulates the expression of mitochondrial respiratory complexes. Therefore, we hypothesized that Nrf2 is involved in the maturation of hiPSC-CMs.</p><h2>Methods</h2> <p>The morphological and functional changes related to mitochondria and cell maturation were analyzed by knock-down and activation of Nrf2.</p><h2>Results</h2> <p>The results showed that the inhibition of Nrf2 led to the retardation of cell maturation. The activation of Nrf2 leads to a more mature hiPSC-CMs phenotype, as indicated by the increase of cardiac maturation markers, sarcomere length, calcium transient dynamics, the number and fusion events of mitochondria, and mitochondrial respiration. Bioinformatics analysis showed that in addition to metabolism-related genes, Nrf2 also activates the expression of myocardial ion channels.</p><h2>Conclusions</h2> <p>These findings indicated that Nrf2 plays an important role in the maturation of hiPSC-CMs. The present work provides greater insights into the molecular regulation of hiPSC-CM metabolism and theoretical basis in drug screening, disease modeling and alternative treatment.</p>"

Inspired by the symbiotic origin of mitochondria and by the cell’s capacity to transfer these organelles to damaged neighbors, many researchers have developed procedures to artificially transfer mitochondria from one cell to another. The techniques currently in use today range from simple coincubations of isolated mitochondria and recipient cells to the use of physical approaches to induce integration. These methods mimic natural mitochondria transfer. In order to use mitochondrial transfer in medicine, we must answer key questions about how to replicate aspects of natural transport processes to improve current artificial transfer methods. Another priority is to determine the optimum quantity and cell/tissue source of the mitochondria in order to induce cell reprogramming or tissue repair, in both in vitro and in vivo applications. Additionally, it is important that the field explores how artificial mitochondria transfer techniques can be used to treat different diseases and how to navigate the ethical issues in such procedures.

Immunoprecipitation after pulse labeling demonstrated that the synthesis of the nuclear subunits was not preferentially inhibited, implying that there is no tight regulation in the synthesis of mitochondrial and nuclear subunits of mitochondrial enzyme complexes. Quantitative analysis of the mitochondrial membrane potential in OP− cells indicated that its magnitude was about 30% of that in control cells. This explains the normal import of the nuclearly encoded subunits of cytochrome-c oxidase and other nuclearly encoded mitochondrial proteins into the mitochondria that was found in OP− cells. The turnover rate of nuclear subunits of cytochrome-c oxidase, determined in pulse-chase experiments, showed a specific increase in OP− cells. Moreover, immunoblotting demonstrated that the steady-state levels of nuclear subunits of cytochrome-c oxidase were severely reduced in these cells, in contrast to those of the F1 part of complex V. Native electrophoresis of mitochondrial enzyme complexes showed that assembly of the nuclear subunits of cytochrome-c oxidase did not occur in OP− cells, whereas the (:nuclear) subunits of F1 were assembled. The increased turnover of the nuclear subunits of cytochrome-c oxidase in OP− cells is, therefore, most likely due to an increased susceptibility of unassembled subunits to intra-mitochondrial degradation.",2-3,1265,117-126,,,https://www.readcube.com/

Both control cells and early passage patient-derived cells express a normal complement of SD and COX subunit proteins. Ethidium bromide treatment of normal cells and in vitro cell proliferation of patient-derived cells caused both populations to acquire identical Rho0 phenotypes.

In contrast, nDNA-encoded subunits are affected differentially, with some (COX-VIc) lacking and others (COX-IV, COX-Va, SD 30 and SD 70) maintained at somewhat reduced levels.

There is evidence that isolated mitochondria enter cells by endocytosis, but the mechanism has not been fully characterised. We investigated the entry mechanism of isolated mitochondria into human osteosarcoma (HOS) cells. Initially we confirmed that respiratory-competent cells can be produced following incubation of HOS cells lacking mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) with functional exogenous mitochondria and selection in a restrictive medium. Treatment of HOS cells with inhibitors of different endocytic pathways suggest that uptake of EGFP-labelled mitochondria occurs via an actin-dependent endocytic pathway which is consistent with macropinocytosis. We later utilised time-lapse microscopy to show that internalised mitochondria were found in large, motile cellular vesicles. Finally, we used confocal imaging to show that EGFP-labelled mitochondria colocalise with a macropinocytic cargo molecule during internalisation, HOS cells produce membrane ruffles interacting with external mitochondria during uptake and EGFP-labelled mitochondria are found within early macropinosomes inside cells. In conclusion our results are consistent with isolated mitochondria being internalised by macropinocytosis in HOS cells.",1,7,12886

Because CS leads to mitochondrial dysfunction, we aimed to investigate the potential benefit of mitochondrial transfer from human-induced pluripotent stem cell–derived MSCs (iPSC-MSCs) to CS-exposed airway epithelial cells in vitro and in vivo. Rats were exposed to 4% CS for 1 hour daily for 56 days. At Days 29 and, human iPSC-MSCs or adult bone marrow–derived MSCs (BM-MSCs) were administered intravenously to CS-exposed rats. CS-exposed rats exhibited severe alveolar destruction with a higher mean linear intercept (Lm) than sham air–exposed rats (P < 0.001) that was attenuated in the presence of iPSC-MSCs or BM-MSCs (P < 0.01). The attenuation of Lm value and the severity of fibrosis was greater in the iPSC-MSC–treated group than in the BM-MSC–treated group (P < 0.05). This might have contributed to the novel observation of mitochondrial transfer from MSCs to rat airway epithelial cells in lung sections exposed to CS. In vitro studies further revealed that transfer of mitochondria from iPSC-MSCs to bronchial epithelial cells (BEAS-2B) was more effective than from BM-MSCs, with preservation of adenosine triphosphate contents. This distinct mitochondrial transfer occurred via the formation of tunneling nanotubes. Inhibition of tunneling nanotube formation blocked mitochondrial transfer. Our findings indicate a higher mitochondrial transfer capacity of iPSC-MSCs than BM-MSCs to rescue CS-induced mitochondrial damage. iPSC-MSCs may thus hold promise for the development of cell therapy in COPD.",3,51,455-465

We describe a method, PANTHER, for relating protein sequence relationships to function relationships in a robust and accurate way. PANTHER is composed of two main components: the PANTHER library (PANTHER/LIB) and the PANTHER index (PANTHER/X). PANTHER/LIB is a collection of “books,” each representing a protein family as a multiple sequence alignment, a Hidden Markov Model (HMM), and a family tree. Functional divergence within the family is represented by dividing the tree into subtrees based on shared function, and by subtree HMMs. PANTHER/X is an abbreviated ontology for summarizing and navigating molecular functions and biological processes associated with the families and subfamilies. We apply PANTHER to three areas of active research. First, we report the size and sequence diversity of the families and subfamilies, characterizing the relationship between sequence divergence and functional divergence across a wide range of protein families. Second, we use the PANTHER/X ontology to give a high-level representation of gene function across the human and mouse genomes. Third, we use the family HMMs to rank missense single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), on a database-wide scale, according to their likelihood of affecting protein function.",9,13,2129-2141

We hypothesized that transplantation of autologously derived mitochondria immediately prior to reperfusion would ameliorate these effects. New Zealand White rabbits were used for regional ischemia (RI), which was achieved by temporarily snaring the left anterior descending artery for 30 min. Following 29 min of RI, autologously derived mitochondria (RI-mitochondria; 9.7 ± 1.7 × 106/ml) or vehicle alone (RI-vehicle) were injected directly into the RI zone, and the hearts were allowed to recover for 4 wk. Mitochondrial transplantation decreased (P < 0.05) creatine kinase MB, cardiac troponin-I, and apoptosis significantly in the RI zone. Infarct size following 4 wk of recovery was decreased significantly in RI-mitochondria (7.9 ± 2.9%) compared with RI-vehicle (34.2 ± 3.3%, P < 0.05). Serial echocardiograms showed that RI-mitochondria hearts returned to normal contraction within 10 min after reperfusion was started; however, RI-vehicle hearts showed persistent hypokinesia in the RI zone at 4 wk of recovery. Electrocardiogram and optical mapping studies showed that no arrhythmia was associated with autologously derived mitochondrial transplantation. In vivo and in vitro studies show that the transplanted mitochondria are evident in the interstitial spaces and are internalized by cardiomyocytes 2–8 h after transplantation. The transplanted mitochondria enhanced oxygen consumption, high-energy phosphate synthesis, and the induction of cytokine mediators and proteomic pathways that are important in preserving myocardial energetics, cell viability, and enhanced post-infarct cardiac function.

Elorza,Juan Pablo Soffia",Frontiers in Cell and Developmental Biology,,,Frontiers Cell Dev Biology,,"The most common aging-associated diseases are cardiovascular diseases which affect 40% of elderly people. Elderly people are prone to suffer aging-associated diseases which are not only related to health and medical cost but also to labor, household productivity and mortality cost. Aging is becoming a world problem and it is estimated that 21.8% of global population will be older than 65 years old in 2050; and for the first time in human history, there will be more elderly people than children. It is well accepted that the origin of aging-associated cardiovascular diseases is mitochondrial dysfunction. Mitochondria have their own genome (mtDNA) that is circular, double-stranded, and 16,569 bp long in humans. There are between 500 to 6000 mtDNA copies per cell which are tissue-specific. As a by-product of ATP production, reactive oxygen species (ROS) are generated which damage proteins, lipids, and mtDNA. ROS-mutated mtDNA co-existing with wild type mtDNA is called mtDNA heteroplasmy. The progressive increase in mtDNA heteroplasmy causes progressive mitochondrial dysfunction leading to a loss in their bioenergetic capacity, disruption in the balance of mitochondrial fusion and fission events (mitochondrial dynamics, MtDy) and decreased mitophagy. This failure in mitochondrial physiology leads to the accumulation of depolarized and ROS-generating mitochondria. Thus, besides attenuated ATP production, dysfunctional mitochondria interfere with proper cellular metabolism and signaling pathways in cardiac cells, contributing to the development of aging-associated cardiovascular diseases. In this context, there is a growing interest to enhance mitochondrial function by decreasing mtDNA heteroplasmy. Reduction in mtDNA heteroplasmy is associated with increased mitophagy, proper MtDy balance and mitochondrial biogenesis; and those processes can delay the onset or progression of cardiovascular diseases. This has led to the development of mitochondrial therapies based on the application of nutritional, pharmacological and genetic treatments. Those seeking to have a positive impact on mtDNA integrity, mitochondrial biogenesis, dynamics and mitophagy in old and sick hearts. This review covers the current knowledge of mitochondrial physiopathology in aging, how disruption of OXPHOS or mitochondrial life cycle alter mtDNA and cardiac cell function; and novel mitochondrial therapies to protect and rescue our heart from cardiovascular diseases.",,9,625020

An innovative therapy that targets the intracellular bioenergetics directly through mitochondria transfer may be necessary. Objectives The purpose of this study was to establish a preclinical proof-of-concept that extracellular vesicle (EV)-mediated transfer of autologous mitochondria and their related energy source enhance cardiac function through restoration of myocardial bioenergetics. Methods Human-induced pluripotent stem cell–derived cardiomyocytes (iCMs) were employed. iCM-conditioned medium was ultracentrifuged to collect mitochondria-rich EVs (M-EVs). Therapeutic effects of M-EVs were investigated using in vivo murine myocardial infarction (MI) model. Results Electron microscopy revealed healthy-shaped mitochondria inside M-EVs. Confocal microscopy showed that M-EV–derived mitochondria were transferred into the recipient iCMs and fused with their endogenous mitochondrial networks. Treatment with 1.0 × 108/ml M-EVs significantly restored the intracellular adenosine triphosphate production and improved contractile profiles of hypoxia-injured iCMs as early as 3 h after treatment. In contrast, isolated mitochondria that contained 300× more mitochondrial proteins than 1.0 × 108/ml M-EVs showed no effect after 24 h. M-EVs contained mitochondrial biogenesis-related messenger ribonucleic acids, including proliferator-activated receptor γ coactivator-1α, which on transfer activated mitochondrial biogenesis in the recipient iCMs at 24 h after treatment. Finally, intramyocardial injection of 1.0 × 108 M-EVs demonstrated significantly improved post-MI cardiac function through restoration of bioenergetics and mitochondrial biogenesis. Conclusions M-EVs facilitated immediate transfer of their mitochondrial and nonmitochondrial cargos, contributing to improved intracellular energetics in vitro. Intramyocardial injection of M-EVs enhanced post-MI cardiac function in vivo. This therapy can be developed as a novel, precision therapeutic for mitochondria-related diseases including heart failure.",8,77,1073-1088

In recent years, rapid emergence of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) and iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes presents a valuable opportunity to replenish the functional cells to the heart. The therapeutic effects of iPSC-derived cells have been investigated in many preclinical studies. However, the underlying mechanisms of iPSC-derived cell therapy are still unclear, and limited engraftment of iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes is well known. One facet of their mechanism is the paracrine effect of the transplanted cells. Microvesicles such as exosomes secreted from the iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes exert protective effects by transferring the endogenous molecules to salvage the injured neighboring cells by regulating apoptosis, inflammation, fibrosis, and angiogenesis. In this review, we will focus on the current advances in the exosomes from iPSC derivatives and discuss their therapeutic potential in the treatment of CVD.",2,120,407-417

Compared to fusion-defective Mfn1/Mfn2 cardiac knockout or fission-defective Drp1 cardiac knockout mice, Mfn1/Mfn2/Drp1 cardiac triple-knockout mice survived longer and manifested a unique pathological form of cardiac hypertrophy. Over time, however, combined abrogation of fission and fusion provoked massive progressive mitochondrial accumulation that severely distorted cardiomyocyte sarcomeric architecture. Mitochondrial biogenesis was not responsible for mitochondrial superabundance, whereas mitophagy was suppressed despite impaired mitochondrial proteostasis. Similar but milder defects were observed in aged hearts. Thus, cardiomyopathies linked to dynamic imbalance between fission and fusion are temporarily mitigated by forced mitochondrial adynamism at the cost of compromising mitochondrial quantity control and accelerating mitochondrial senescence.",6,26,872-883.e5

Treatment with the NAD+ metabolic precursor nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN) rejuvenates oocyte quality in aged animals, leading to restoration in fertility, and this can be recapitulated by transgenic overexpression of the NAD+-dependent deacylase SIRT2, though deletion of this enzyme does not impair oocyte quality.

Mitochondria, which play a key role in energy homeostasis and metabolism of reactive oxygen species (ROS), require lifetime control and constant renewal. This explains recently peaked interest in the processes of mitochondrial biogenesis and mitophagy. The principal event of mitochondrial metabolism is regulation of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) transcription and translation, which is a complex coordinated process that involves at least two systems of transcription factors. It is commonly believed that its major regulatory proteins are PGC-1α and PGC-1β, which act as key factors connecting several regulator cascades involved in the control of mitochondrial metabolism. In recent years, the number of publications on the essential role of Nrf2/ARE signaling in the regulation of mitochondrial biogenesis has grown exponentially. Nrf2 is induced by various xenobiotics and oxidants that oxidize some Nrf2 negative regulators. Thus, ROS, in particular H2O2, were found to be strong Nrf2 activators. At present, there are two major concepts of mitochondrial biogenesis. Some authors suggest direct involvement of Nrf2 in the regulation of this process. Others believe that Nrf2 regulates expression of the antioxidant genes, while the major and only regulator of mitochondrial biogenesis is PGC-1α. Several studies have demonstrated the existence of the regulatory loop involving both PGC-1α and Nrf2. In this review, we summarized recent data on the Nrf2 role in mitochondrial biogenesis and its interaction with PGC-1α in the context of extending longevity.",,10,435

To address this question we have developed and describe here a sequential centrifugal ultrafiltration (SCUF) method to examine, in an unbiased manner, what EV subtypes are released in vitro into cell culture medium using the human colon carcinoma cell line LIM1863 as a model system. Using the culture medium from ∼7.2×109 LIM1863 cells, SCUF was performed using hydrophilic PVDF membranes with low protein binding properties (Millipore Durapore™ Ultrafree-CL filters with 0.1, 0.22, 0.45 and 0.65μm pore size). EV particle sizing was measured using both dynamic light scattering and cryo-electron microscopy. Comparative proteome profiling was performed by GeLC–MS/MS and qualitative protein differences between EV subtypes determined by label-free spectral counting. The results showed essentially two EV subtypes; one subtype (fraction Fn1) comprised heterogeneous EVs with particle diameters of 30–1300nm, the other (fraction Fn5) being homogeneous EVs of 30–100nm diameter; based on cryo-EM both EV subtypes were round shaped. Western blot analysis showed Fn5 (SCUF-Exos) contained traditional exosome marker proteins (Alix+, TSG101+, CD81+, CD63+), while Fn1 (SCUF-sMVs) lacked these protein markers. These findings were consistent with sMVs isolated by differential centrifugation (10,000g, DC-sMVs) and exosomes (100,000g EVs depleted of 10,000g material). The buoyant density of sMVs determined by OptiPrep™ density gradient centrifugation was 1.18–1.19g/mL and exosomes 1.10–1.11g/mL. Comparative protein profiling of SCUF-Exos/-sMVs revealed 354 and 606 unambiguous protein identifications, respectively, with 256 proteins in common. A salient finding was the first report of 350 proteins uniquely identified in sMVs may of which have the potential to enable discrimination of this EV subtype from exosomes (notably, members of the septin family, kinesin-like protein (KIF23), exportin-2/chromosome segregation like-1 protein (CSE1L), and Rac GTPase-activating protein 1 (RACGAP1)). We report for the first time that both SCUF-Exos and SCUF-sMVs isolated from LIM1863 colon cancer cells induce invasion of recipient NIH3T3 cells. Interestingly, the SCUF-sMVs promote invasion to a significantly greater extent (3-fold) than SCUF-Exos. This analytical SCUF method for fractionating EVs is potentially scalable using tangential flow filtration, thereby providing a solid foundation for future in-depth functional studies of EV subtypes using diverse cell types and functional assays.",,87,11-25

Their importance in cancer and inflammation makes EVs and their cargo promising biomarkers of disease and cell-free therapeutic agents. Emerging high-resolution cytometric methods have created a pressing need for efficient fluorescent labeling procedures to visualize and detect EVs. Suitable labels must be bright enough for one EV to be detected without the generation of label-associated artifacts. To identify a strategy that robustly labels individual EVs, we used nanoFACS, a high-resolution flow cytometric method that utilizes light scattering and fluorescence parameters along with sample enumeration, to evaluate various labels. Specifically, we compared lipid-, protein-, and RNA-based staining methods and developed a robust EV staining strategy, with the amine-reactive fluorescent label, 5-(and-6)-Carboxyfluorescein Diacetate Succinimidyl Ester, and size exclusion chromatography to remove unconjugated label. By combining nanoFACS measurements of light scattering and fluorescence, we evaluated the sensitivity and specificity of EV labeling assays in a manner that has not been described for other EV detection methods. Efficient characterization of EVs by nanoFACS paves the way towards further study of EVs and their roles in health and disease.",1,7,1878

Using the sensitive real-time polymerase chain reaction to quantify the A3243G mutation, we confirmed that the percent mutation decreases progressively in DNA isolated from blood: the average percent decrease was 0.5% per year for fully symptomatic patients and 0.2% per year for oligosymptomatic carrier relatives. We also correlated mutant loads with functional status estimated by the Karnofksky score: even though the mutation load decreases, the level of functioning worsens in fully symptomatic patients, whereas the level of functioning of carrier relatives remains largely unchanged.

Increase of total mtDNA levels ameliorated pathology in multiple tissues, although the levels of heteroplasmy remained the same. A reduction in mtDNA levels worsened the phenotype in postmitotic tissues, such as heart, whereas there was an unexpected beneficial effect in rapidly proliferating tissues, such as colon, because of enhanced clonal expansion and selective elimination of mutated mtDNA. The absolute levels of WT mtDNA are thus an important determinant of the pathological manifestations, suggesting that pharmacological or gene therapy approaches to selectively increase mtDNA copy number provide a potential treatment strategy for human mtDNA mutation disease.",4,5,eaav9824,,,https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/advances/5/4/eaav9824.full.pdf

New mutations in mtDNA segregate rapidly in the female germline due to a genetic bottleneck in early oogenesis1–3 and as a result most individuals are homoplasmic for a single species of mtDNA. Sequence variants thus accumulate along maternal lineages without genetic recombination. Most of the extant variation in mtDNA in mammalian populations has been assumed to be neutral with respect to selection4; however, comparisons of the ratio of replacement to silent nucleotide substitutions between species suggest that the evolution of mammalian mtDNA is not strictly neutral5. To test directly whether polymorphic mtDNAs behave as neutral variants, we examined the segregation of two different mtDNA genotypes in the tissues of heteroplasmic mice. We find evidence for random genetic drift in some tissues, but in others strong, tissue-specific and age-related, directional selection for different mtDNA genotypes in the same animal. These surprising data suggest that the coding sequence of mtDNA may represent a compromise between the competing demands of different tissues and point to the existence of unknown, tissue-specific nuclear genes important in the interaction between the nuclear and mitochondrial genomes.",1,16,93-95,,,https://www.nature.com/articles/ng0597-93.pdf

The screen yielded GOT1, the cytosolic aspartate aminotransferase, loss of which kills cells upon ETC inhibition. GOT1 normally consumes aspartate to transfer electrons into mitochondria, but, upon ETC inhibition, it reverses to generate aspartate in the cytosol, which partially compensates for the loss of mitochondrial aspartate synthesis. Pyruvate stimulates aspartate synthesis in a GOT1-dependent fashion, which is required for pyruvate to rescue proliferation of cells with ETC dysfunction. Aspartate supplementation or overexpression of an aspartate transporter allows cells without ETC activity to proliferate.

First, we applied global metabolic profiling to spotlight 32 metabolites whose uptake or secretion kinetics were altered by chemical inhibition of the respiratory chain in cultured muscle . These metabolites span a wide range of pathways and include lactate and alanine, which are used clinically as biomarkers of RCD. We next measured the cell culture-defined metabolites in human plasma to discover that creatine is reproducibly elevated in two independent cohorts of RCD patients, exceeding lactate and alanine in magnitude of elevation and statistical significance. In cell culture extracellular creatine was inversely related to the intracellular phosphocreatine:creatine ratio suggesting that the elevation of plasma creatine in RCD patients signals a low energetic state of tissues using the phosphocreatine shuttle. Our study identifies plasma creatine as a potential biomarker of human mitochondrial dysfunction that could be clinically useful.

After the formation of embryoid bodies (EBs), iPS cells spontaneously differentiated into Flk1-positive cardiac progenitors and cardiomyocytes expressing cardiac-specific markers such as alpha sarcomeric actinin (α-actinin), cardiac alpha myosin heavy chain (α-MHC), cardiac troponin T (cTnT), and connexin 43 (CX43), as well as cardiac transcription factors Nk2 homebox 5 (Nkx2.5) and gata binding protein 4 (gata4). The electrophysiological activity of iPS cell-derived cardiomyocytes (iPS-CMs) was detected in beating cell clusters with optical mapping and RH237 a voltage-sensitive dye, and in single contracting cells with patch-clamp technology. Incompletely differentiated iPS cells formed teratomas when transplanted into a severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) mouse model of myocardial infarction. Our results show that somatic cells can be reprogrammed into pluripotent stem cells, which in turn spontaneously differentiate into electrophysiologically functional mature cardiomyocytes expressing cardiac-specific makers, and that these cells can potentially be used to repair myocardial infarction (MI) in the future.",2,16,522-530,,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4828332/pdf/nihms767977.pdf

In addition, the spermatogonia expressing GFRA1 exhibited a potential for proliferation and the ability to form colonies in culture, which is a characteristic of stem cells. RNA interference assays showed that Gfra1 small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) knocked down the expression of Gfra1 mRNA and GFRA1 protein in type A spermatogonia. Notably, the reduction of Gfra1 expression by Gfra1 siRNAs induced a phenotypic differentiation, as evidenced by the elevated expression of KIT, as well as the decreased expression of POU5F1 and proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA). Furthermore, Gfra1 silencing resulted in a decrease in RET phosphorylation. Taken together, these data indicate that Gfra1 is expressed dominantly in mouse spermatogonial stem cells and that Gfra1 knockdown leads to their differentiation via the inactivation of RET tyrosine kinase, suggesting an essential role for Gfra1 in spermatogonial stem cell regulation.",4,77,723-733

The stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes described to date exhibit rather immature functional and structural characteristics compared to adult cardiomyocytes. Thus, a future challenge will be to develop strategies to reach a higher degree of cardiomyocyte maturation in vitro, to isolate cardiomyocytes from the heterogeneous pool of differentiating cells, as well as to guide the differentiation into the desired subtype, that is, ventricular, atrial, and pacemaker cells.

Changes in mitochondrial morphology have been shown to occur during cellular reprogramming and pluripotent stem cell differentiation. However, the relationships between mitochondrial dynamics and cardiac mesoderm commitment of iPSCs remain unclear. Here we demonstrate that changes in mitochondrial morphology from a small granular fragmented phenotype in pluripotent stem cells to a filamentous reticular elongated network in differentiated cardiomyocytes are required for cardiac mesodermal differentiation. Genetic and pharmacological inhibition of the mitochondrial fission protein, Drp1, by either small interfering RNA or Mdivi-1, respectively, increased cardiac mesoderm gene expression in iPSCs. Treatment of iPSCs with Mdivi-1 during embryoid body formation significantly increased the percentage of beating embryoid bodies and expression of cardiac-specific genes. Furthermore, Drp1 gene silencing was accompanied by increased mitochondrial respiration and decreased aerobic glycolysis. Our findings demonstrate that shifting the balance of mitochondrial morphology toward fusion by inhibition of Drp1 promoted cardiac differentiation of human iPSCs with a metabolic shift from glycolysis towards oxidative phosphorylation. These findings suggest that Drp1 may represent a new molecular target for future development of strategies to promote the differentiation of human iPSCs into cardiac lineages for patient-specific cardiac regenerative medicine.",1,4,39

Co-culture of purified mouse iPSC-derived Flk1+ cells with OP9 stroma cells induced cardiomyocyte differentiation whilst addition of CSA to Flk1+ cells dramatically increased both cardiomyocyte and FCV progenitor cell differentiation. Spontaneously beating colonies were obtained from human iPSCs by co-culture with END-2 visceral endoderm-like cells. Appearance of beating colonies from human iPSCs was increased approximately 4.3 times by addition of CSA at mesoderm stage.

Piersma",Reproductive Toxicology,,,Reprod Toxicol,0890-6238," In search for alternative methods for developmental toxicity testing, we investigated whether embryonic stem cell (ESC) differentiation and its modulation by toxic exposure could be monitored by proteome profiling. We compared the proteomes of mouse ESC, differentiating ESC (DIF) and differentiating ESC exposed to the embryotoxicant monobutyl phthalate (MBP). Experiments were performed in duplicates for each cell culture and the proteins extracted from the cells were separated by one-dimensional SDS-PAGE. The identified proteins were quantified using a label-free quantitative method based on counting the observed peptides as an index of protein abundance. Fifty-seven proteins were upregulated in DIF relative to ESC, whereas 42 proteins were downregulated. Most of the upregulated proteins could be correlated with cardiomyocyte functionality. In contrast, the downregulated proteins were principally pluripotency markers, chaperones and ribosomal proteins. Higher expression levels of enzymes involved in DNA mismatch repair (MSH6) and in methylation reactions (MAT2A, AHCY) were also detected in the ESC, suggesting that these processes are more active in the ESC. In addition, the detection of gluthatione S-transferase alpha 4 (GSTA4) and Park7 DJ-1 protein (antioxidant) in ESC indicates that these cells have potential detoxification mechanisms. Furthermore, MBP affected the expression of 33 proteins, including MYH6, a cardiomyocyte-specific protein, which was significantly downregulated. MBP also affected the expression levels of chaperones, metabolic enzymes and chromatin modulating proteins, suggesting that MBP alters the differentiation process. Western blot analysis of MYH6 and HSPB1 confirmed the proteomic data. In addition, a favorable correlation was observed between protein expression and published changes in the expression of related genes at the transcriptomics level. Together, the results reveal potential protein markers that may be used as endpoints in an ESC based animal free alternative test for embryotoxicity though further studies are required for confirmation.",2,30,322-332

Lovell,Nathaniel W. Snyder,Kathryn E. Wellen",Molecular Metabolism,,,Mol Metab,2212-8778,"Background Many metabolites serve as important signalling molecules to adjust cellular activities and functions based on nutrient availability. Links between acetyl-CoA metabolism, histone lysine acetylation, and gene expression have been documented and studied over the past decade. In recent years, several additional acyl modifications to histone lysine residues have been identified, which depend on acyl-coenzyme A thioesters (acyl-CoAs) as acyl donors. Acyl-CoAs are intermediates of multiple distinct metabolic pathways, and substantial evidence has emerged that histone acylation is metabolically sensitive. Nevertheless, the metabolic sources of acyl-CoAs used for chromatin modification in most cases remain poorly understood. Elucidating how these diverse chemical modifications are coupled to and regulated by cellular metabolism is important in deciphering their functional significance. Scope of review In this article, we review the metabolic pathways that produce acyl-CoAs, as well as emerging evidence for functional roles of diverse acyl-CoAs in chromatin regulation. Because acetyl-CoA has been extensively reviewed elsewhere, we will focus on four other acyl-CoA metabolites integral to major metabolic pathways that are also known to modify histones: succinyl-CoA, propionyl-CoA, crotonoyl-CoA, and butyryl-CoA. We also briefly mention several other acyl-CoA species, which present opportunities for further research; malonyl-CoA, glutaryl-CoA, 3-hydroxybutyryl-CoA, 2-hydroxyisobutyryl-CoA, and lactyl-CoA. Each acyl-CoA species has distinct roles in metabolism, indicating the potential to report shifts in the metabolic status of the cell. For each metabolite, we consider the metabolic pathways in which it participates and the nutrient sources from which it is derived, the compartmentalisation of its metabolism, and the factors reported to influence its abundance and potential nuclear availability. We also highlight reported biological functions of these metabolically-linked acylation marks. Finally, we aim to illuminate key questions in acyl-CoA metabolism as they relate to the control of chromatin modification. Major conclusions A majority of acyl-CoA species are annotated to mitochondrial metabolic processes. Since acyl-CoAs are not known to be directly transported across mitochondrial membranes, they must be synthesized outside of mitochondria and potentially within the nucleus to participate in chromatin regulation. Thus, subcellular metabolic compartmentalisation likely plays a key role in the regulation of histone acylation. Metabolite tracing in combination with targeting of relevant enzymes and transporters will help to map the metabolic pathways that connect acyl-CoA metabolism to chromatin modification. The specific function of each acyl-CoA may be determined in part by biochemical properties that affect its propensity for enzymatic versus non-enzymatic protein modification, as well as the various enzymes that can add, remove and bind each modification. Further, competitive and inhibitory effects of different acyl-CoA species on these enzymes make determining the relative abundance of acyl-CoA species in specific contexts important to understand the regulation of chromatin acylation. An improved and more nuanced understanding of metabolic regulation of chromatin and its roles in physiological and disease-related processes will emerge as these questions are answered.",,38,100941

As human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs) hold potential in the treatment of heart diseases, we sought to identify key mitochondrial pathways and regulators, which may provide targets for improving cardiac differentiation and maturation. Proteomic analysis was performed on enriched mitochondrial protein extracts isolated from hiPSC-CMs differentiated from dermal fibroblasts (dFCM) and cardiac fibroblasts (cFCM) at time points between 12 and 115 days of differentiation, and from adult and neonatal mouse hearts. Mitochondrial proteins with a 2-fold change at time points up to 120 days relative to 12 days were subjected to Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA). The highest upregulation was in metabolic pathways for fatty acid oxidation (FAO), the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) and branched chain amino acid (BCAA) degradation. The top upstream regulators predicted to be activated were peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1 alpha (PGC1-α), the insulin receptor (IR) and the retinoblastoma protein (Rb1) transcriptional repressor. IPA and immunoblotting showed upregulation of the mitochondrial LonP1 protease - a regulator of mitochondrial proteostasis, energetics and metabolism. LonP1 knockdown increased FAO in neonatal rat ventricular cardiomyocytes (nRVMs). Our results support the notion that LonP1 upregulation negatively regulates FAO in cardiomyocytes to calibrate the flux between glucose and fatty acid oxidation. We discuss potential mechanisms by which IR, Rb1 and LonP1 regulate the metabolic shift from glycolysis to OXPHOS and FAO. These newly identified factors and pathways may help in optimizing the maturation of iPSC-CMs."

The proteome of hiPSCs induced by 4 core transcription factors was relatively similar to that of hESCs. However, several proteins, including dUTPase, GAPDH, and FUSE binding protein 3, were differentially expressed between hESCs and hiPSCs, implying that hiPSCs are not identical to hESCs at the proteomic level.

However, uncovering fate determinants is challenging, as fission is unpredictable, and mitochondrial morphology is heterogeneous, with ultrastructural features that are below the diffraction limit. Here, we used live-cell structured illumination microscopy to capture mitochondrial dynamics. By analysing hundreds of fissions in African green monkey Cos-7 cells and mouse cardiomyocytes, we discovered two functionally and mechanistically distinct types of fission. Division at the periphery enables damaged material to be shed into smaller mitochondria destined for mitophagy, whereas division at the midzone leads to the proliferation of mitochondria. Both types are mediated by DRP1, but endoplasmic reticulum- and actin-mediated pre-constriction and the adaptor MFF govern only midzone fission. Peripheral fission is preceded by lysosomal contact and is regulated by the mitochondrial outer membrane protein FIS1. These distinct molecular mechanisms explain how cells independently regulate fission, leading to distinct mitochondrial fates. Mitochondrial fission at the organelle periphery generates small daughter mitochondria that are removed by mitophagy whereas fission at the midzone leads to proliferation.",,,1-5

More than 15 FAO genetic defects have been currently described, and pathological variants described in circumpolar populations provide insights into its critical role in metabolism. The use of fatty acids as energy requires more than 2 dozen enzymes and transport proteins, which are involved in the activation and transport of fatty acids into the mitochondria. As the key rate-limiting enzyme of FAO, carnitine palmitoyltransferase I (CPT1) regulates FAO and facilitates adaptation to the environment, both in health and in disease, including cancer.

This review focuses on CPT1A, the liver isoform that catalyzes the rate-limiting step of converting acyl-coenzyme As into acyl-carnitines, which can then cross membranes to get into the mitochondria. The regulation of CPT1A is complex and has several layers that involve genetic, epigenetic, physiological, and nutritional modulators. It is ubiquitously expressed in the body and associated with dire consequences linked with genetic mutations, metabolic disorders, and cancers. This makes CPT1A an attractive target for therapeutic interventions.

In many forms of heart disease, including heart failure, ischaemic heart disease and diabetic cardiomyopathies, changes in cardiac mitochondrial energy metabolism contribute to contractile dysfunction and to a decrease in cardiac efficiency. Specific metabolic changes include a relative increase in cardiac fatty acid oxidation rates and an uncoupling of glycolysis from glucose oxidation. In heart failure, overall mitochondrial oxidative metabolism can be impaired while, in ischaemic heart disease, energy production is impaired due to a limitation of oxygen supply. In both of these conditions, residual mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation dominates over mitochondrial glucose oxidation. In diabetes, the ratio of cardiac fatty acid oxidation to glucose oxidation also increases, although primarily due to an increase in fatty acid oxidation and an inhibition of glucose oxidation. Recent evidence suggests that therapeutically regulating cardiac energy metabolism by reducing fatty acid oxidation and/or increasing glucose oxidation can improve cardiac function of the ischaemic heart, the failing heart and in diabetic cardiomyopathies. In this article, we review the cardiac mitochondrial energy metabolic changes that occur in these forms of heart disease, what role alterations in mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation have in contributing to cardiac dysfunction and the potential for targeting fatty acid oxidation to treat these forms of heart disease.

The mechanisms remain unclear with regard to the dose and timing of each differentiation inducer, and the interaction of the inducers that regulate the Wnt in mesendoderm specification to cardiac mesoderm. Consequently, it remains far from optimal in differentiation efficiency and consistency from hiPSC lines to CMs. Here, we have carefully deciphered the role of Wnt signaling pathway manipulation on mesoderm specification in a dosage and time dependent manner. To examine the hypothesis of that fate specification of hiPSC-CMs differentiation is dictated by temporal and spatial factors that regulate Wnt, we evaluate hiPSC-CM differentiation with: (1) two-phase modulation of Wnt, (2) dosage variant of GSK3β inhibitors, (3) treatment with insulin, and (4) 3-dimentional suspension culture environment on iPSC-CM differentiation. The results highlight the importance of mesendoderm specification to cardiac mesoderm, which needs precisely regulation of Wnt in a dosage dependent and temporal on/off manner. This temporal regulation dictates the final efficiency and purity of derived cardiomyocytes. After the initial activation of Wnt signaling pathway to generate mesendoderm, the maintenance of Wnt signaling at an appropriate dose is critical to direct the cell fate into cardiac mesoderm. Otherwise, lower Wnt signals lead to definitive endoderm and higher Wnt signals induce presomitic mesoderm differentiation. The precisely specification of cardiac mesoderm results in not only greater than 90% of cTnT+ cardiomyocytes but also high cardiomyocytes yield under both monolayer and suspension culture conditions. Thus, the current findings provide critical insights to decipher the temporal mechanism of Wnt activation in regulation of hiPSC-CMs differentiation, and more importantly provide the guidelines for the consistent and high-yield and high-quality hiPSC-CMs production in cardiovascular research.",1,9,19389

Furthermore, sequential treatment of hPSCs with glycogen synthase kinase 3 inhibitors followed by inducible expression of β-catenin shRNA or chemical inhibitors of Wnt signaling produced a high yield of virtually (up to 98%) pure functional human cardiomyocytes from multiple hPSC lines.

Zweier",Circulation Research,,,Circ Res,0009-7330,"Mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) have emerged as an important mechanism of disease and redox signaling in the cardiovascular system. Under basal or pathological conditions, electron leakage for ROS production is primarily mediated by the electron transport chain and the proton motive force consisting of a membrane potential (ΔΨ) and a proton gradient (ΔpH). Several factors controlling ROS production in the mitochondria include flavin mononucleotide and flavin mononucleotide–binding domain of complex I, ubisemiquinone and quinone-binding domain of complex I, flavin adenine nucleotide–binding moiety and quinone-binding pocket of complex II, and unstable semiquinone mediated by the Q cycle of complex III. In mitochondrial complex I, specific cysteinyl redox domains modulate ROS production from the flavin mononucleotide moiety and iron–sulfur clusters. In the cardiovascular system, mitochondrial ROS have been linked to mediating the physiological effects of metabolic dilation and preconditioning-like mitochondrial ATP-sensitive potassium channel activation. Furthermore, oxidative post-translational modification by glutathione in complex I and complex II has been shown to affect enzymatic catalysis, protein–protein interactions, and enzyme-mediated ROS production. Conditions associated with oxidative or nitrosative stress, such as myocardial ischemia and reperfusion, increase mitochondrial ROS production via oxidative injury of complexes I and II and superoxide anion radical–induced hydroxyl radical production by aconitase.

We investigated the mitochondrial metabolic pathways and enzymes that were decreased following in vivo hypoxia, and questioned whether hypoxic adaptation was protective for the mitochondria. Wistar rats were housed in hypoxia (7 days acclimatisation and 14 days at 11 % oxygen), while control rats were housed in normoxia. Chronic exposure to physiological hypoxia increased haematocrit and cardiac vascular endothelial growth factor, in the absence of weight loss and changes in cardiac mass. In both subsarcolemmal (SSM) and interfibrillar (IFM) mitochondria isolated from hypoxic hearts, state 3 respiration rates with fatty acid were decreased by 17–18 %, and with pyruvate were decreased by 29–15 %, respectively. State 3 respiration rates with electron transport chain (ETC) substrates were decreased only in hypoxic SSM, not in hypoxic IFM. SSM from hypoxic hearts had decreased activities of ETC complexes I, II and IV, which were associated with decreased reactive oxygen species generation and protection against mitochondrial permeability transition pore (MPTP) opening. In contrast, IFM from hypoxic hearts had decreased activity of the Krebs cycle enzyme, aconitase, which did not modify ROS production or MPTP opening. In conclusion, cardiac mitochondrial respiration was decreased following chronic hypoxia, associated with downregulation of different pathways in the two mitochondrial populations, determined by their subcellular location. Hypoxic adaptation was not deleterious for the mitochondria, in fact, SSM acquired increased protection against oxidative damage under the oxygen-limited conditions.",3,107,268

The transition from the ancestral endosymbiont to the modern mitochondrion has been accompanied by major changes in its protein content, the so-called proteome. These changes included complete loss of some bacterial pathways, amelioration of others and gain of completely new complexes of eukaryotic origin such as the ATP/ADP translocase and most of the mitochondrial protein import machinery. This renewal of proteins has been so extensive that only 14–16% of modern mitochondrial proteome has an origin that can be traced back to the bacterial endosymbiont. The rest consists of proteins of diverse origin that were eventually recruited to function in the organelle. This shaping of the proteome content reflects the transformation of mitochondria into a highly specialized organelle that, besides ATP production, comprises a variety of functions within the eukaryotic metabolism.

G. Kurland,S. G. E. Andersson",Microbiology and Molecular Biology Reviews,,,Microbiol Mol Biol R,1092-2172,"The endosymbiotic theory for the origin of mitochondria requires substantial modification. The three identifiable ancestral sources to the proteome of mitochondria are proteins descended from the ancestral α-proteobacteria symbiont, proteins with no homology to bacterial orthologs, and diverse proteins with bacterial affinities not derived from α-proteobacteria. Random mutations in the form of deletions large and small seem to have eliminated nonessential genes from the endosymbiont-mitochondrial genome lineages. This process, together with the transfer of genes from the endosymbiont-mitochondrial genome to nuclei, has led to a marked reduction in the size of mitochondrial genomes. All proteins of bacterial descent that are encoded by nuclear genes were probably transferred by the same mechanism, involving the disintegration of mitochondria or bacteria by the intracellular membranous vacuoles of cells to release nucleic acid fragments that transform the nuclear genome. This ongoing process has intermittently introduced bacterial genes to nuclear genomes. The genomes of the last common ancestor of all organisms, in particular of mitochondria, encoded cytochrome oxidase homologues. There are no phylogenetic indications either in the mitochondrial proteome or in the nuclear genomes that the initial or subsequent function of the ancestor to the mitochondria was anaerobic. In contrast, there are indications that relatively advanced eukaryotes adapted to anaerobiosis by dismantling their mitochondria and refitting them as hydrogenosomes. Accordingly, a continuous history of aerobic respiration seems to have been the fate of most mitochondrial lineages. The initial phases of this history may have involved aerobic respiration by the symbiont functioning as a scavenger of toxic oxygen. The transition to mitochondria capable of active ATP export to the host cell seems to have required recruitment of eukaryotic ATP transport proteins from the nucleus. The identity of the ancestral host of the α-proteobacterial endosymbiont is unclear, but there is no indication that it was an autotroph. There are no indications of a specific α-proteobacterial origin to genes for glycolysis. In the absence of data to the contrary, it is assumed that the ancestral host cell was a heterotroph.",4,64,786-820

With these criteria, 382 proteins in the significantly different groups were confirmed to be mitochondrial, and 493 could not be confirmed to be mitochondrial but were not definitively localized elsewhere in the cell. A total of 145 proteins were assigned to the rat mitochondrial proteome for the first time via their NH2-terminal mitochondrial localization signals. Among the proteins that were not significantly different between tissues, three were confirmed to be mitochondrial. Most notable of the significantly different proteins were histone family proteins and several structural proteins, including tubulin and intermediate filaments.

These data were inserted into the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway framework to give global and metabolic pathway-specific information on the impact of the differential protein distribution on mitochondrial function. Custom pathway analysis was also performed using pathways limited to the mitochondrion. With the use of this approach, several well-known functional differences between these mitochondrial populations were confirmed. These included GABA metabolism in the brain, urea synthesis in the liver, and the domination of oxidative phosphorylation in the heart. By comparing relative protein amounts of mitochondria across tissues, a greater understanding of functional emphasis is possible as well as the nuclear “programming” required to enhance a given function within the mitochondria. For proteins determined to be mitochondrial and lacking a defined role functional domain BLAST analyses were performed. Several proteins associated with DNA structural modification and a novel CoA transferase were identified. A protein was also identified capable of catalyzing the first three steps of de novo pyrimidine synthesis.

We hypothesized that mitochondria may play an important role because of their involvement in energy production. Methods and Results— Mitochondria isolated from the left ventricle in a canine model of dyssynchronous or resynchronized (CRT) heart failure were analyzed by a classical, gel-based, proteomic approach. Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis revealed that 31 mitochondrial proteins where changed when controlling the false discovery rate at 30%. Key enzymes in anaplerotic pathways, such as pyruvate carboxylation and branched-chain amino acid oxidation, were increased. These concerted changes, along with others, suggested that CRT may increase the pool of Krebs cycle intermediates and fuel oxidative phosphorylation. Nearly 50% of observed changes pertained to subunits of the respiratory chain. ATP synthase-&bgr; subunit of complex V was less degraded, and its phosphorylation modulated by CRT was associated with increased formation (2-fold, P&equals;0.004) and specific activity (&plus;20%, P&equals;0.05) of the mature complex. The importance of these modifications was supported by coordinated changes in mitochondrial chaperones and proteases. CRT increased the mitochondrial respiratory control index with tightened coupling when isolated mitochondria were reexposed to substrates for both complex I (glutamate and malate) and complex II (succinate), an effect likely related to ATP synthase subunit modifications and complex quantity and activity. Conclusions— CRT potently affects both the mitochondrial proteome and the performance associated with improved cardiac function.",1,3,78-87

To maintain long-term fertility and sustain sufficiently high levels of spermatogenesis, a delicate balance needs to prevail between the different niche factors that control cell fate decisions of SSCs by promoting self-renewal, differentiation priming or spermatogenic commitment of undifferentiated spermatogonia (Aundiff). Previously the SSC niche was thought to be formed primarily by Sertoli cells. However, recent research has indicated that many distinct cell types within the testis contribute to the SSC niche including most somatic cell populations and differentiating germ cells. Moreover, postnatal testis development involves maturation of somatic supporting cell populations and onset of cyclic function of the seminiferous epithelium. The stochastic and flexible behavior of Aundiff further complicates the definition of the SSC niche. Unlike in invertebrate species, providing a simple anatomical description of the SSC niche in the mouse is therefore challenging. Rather, the niche needs to be understood as a dynamic system that is able to serve the long-term reproductive function and maintenance of fertility both under steady-state and during development plus regeneration. Recent data from us and others have also shown that Aundiff reversibly transition between differentiation-primed and self-renewing states based on availability of niche-derived cues.

Critical Issues: Respiration is associated with the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) by the mitochondrial respiratory chain.

ROS not only play a significant role in stem cell differentiation and tissue renewal but also cause senescence and contribute to tissue aging.

Embryonic and fetal development are highly dynamic periods during which the developing embryo or fetus is exposed to changing nutrient, oxygen, and hormone levels until birth. It is becoming increasingly apparent that these metabolic changes initiate developmental processes to mature cardiomyocytes. Mitochondria are central to these changes, responding to these metabolic changes and transitioning from small, fragmented mitochondria to large organelles capable of producing enough ATP to support the contractile function of the heart. These changes in mitochondria may not simply be a response to cardiomyocyte maturation; the metabolic signals that occur throughout development may actually be central to the maturation process in cardiomyocytes. Here, we review methods to enhance maturation of PSC-CMs and highlight evidence from development indicating the key roles that mitochondria play during cardiomyocyte maturation. We evaluate metabolic transitions that occur during development and how these affect molecular nutrient sensors, discuss how regulation of nutrient sensing pathways affect mitochondrial dynamics and function, and explore how changes in mitochondrial function can affect metabolite production, the cell cycle, and epigenetics to influence maturation of cardiomyocytes.",1,12,177

Bosnjak,Xiaowen Bai",Cells,,,Cells,,"Human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived cardiomyocytes (CMs) (iPSC-CMs) are a promising cell source for myocardial regeneration, disease modeling and drug assessment. However, iPSC-CMs exhibit immature fetal CM-like characteristics that are different from adult CMs in several aspects, including cellular structure and metabolism. As an example, glycolysis is a major energy source for immature CMs. As CMs mature, the mitochondrial oxidative capacity increases, with fatty acid β-oxidation becoming a key energy source to meet the heart’s high energy demand. The immaturity of iPSC-CMs thereby limits their applications. The aim of this study was to investigate whether the energy substrate fatty acid-treated iPSC-CMs exhibit adult CM-like metabolic properties. After 20 days of differentiation from human iPSCs, iPSC-CMs were sequentially cultured with CM purification medium (lactate+/glucose-) for 7 days and maturation medium (fatty acids+/glucose-) for 3–7 days by mimicking the adult CM’s preference of utilizing fatty acids as a major metabolic substrate. The purity and maturity of iPSC-CMs were characterized via the analysis of: (1) Expression of CM-specific markers (e.g., troponin T, and sodium and potassium channels) using RT-qPCR, Western blot or immunofluorescence staining and electron microscopy imaging; and (2) cell energy metabolic profiles using the XF96 Extracellular Flux Analyzer. iPSCs-CMs (98% purity) cultured in maturation medium exhibited enhanced elongation, increased mitochondrial numbers with more aligned Z-lines, and increased expression of matured CM-related genes, suggesting that fatty acid-contained medium promotes iPSC-CMs to undergo maturation. In addition, the oxygen consumption rate (OCR) linked to basal respiration, ATP production, and maximal respiration and spare respiratory capacity (representing mitochondrial function) was increased in matured iPSC-CMs. Mature iPSC-CMs also displayed a larger change in basal and maximum respirations due to the utilization of exogenous fatty acids (palmitate) compared with non-matured control iPSC-CMs. Etomoxir (a carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1 inhibitor) but not 2-deoxyglucose (an inhibitor of glycolysis) abolished the palmitate pretreatment-mediated OCR increases in mature iPSC-CMs. Collectively, our data demonstrate for the first time that fatty acid treatment promotes metabolic maturation of iPSC-CMs (as evidenced by enhanced mitochondrial oxidative function and strong capacity of utilizing fatty acids as energy source). These matured iPSC-CMs might be a promising human CM source for broad biomedical application.",9,8,1095

Fatty acid treatment induces cardiomyocyte hypertrophy and significantly increases cardiomyocyte force production. The improvement in force generation is accompanied by enhanced calcium transient peak height and kinetics, and by increased action potential upstroke velocity and membrane capacitance. Fatty acids also enhance mitochondrial respiratory reserve capacity. RNA sequencing showed that fatty acid treatment upregulates genes involved in fatty acid β-oxidation and downregulates genes in lipid synthesis. Signal pathway analyses reveal that fatty acid treatment results in phosphorylation and activation of multiple intracellular kinases. Thus, fatty acids increase human cardiomyocyte hypertrophy, force generation, calcium dynamics, action potential upstroke velocity, and oxidative capacity.

A transient wave of increased cell cycle activity of cardiomyocyte was observed between postnatal day 3 and 5, that proceeded as cardiomyocyte hypertrophic growth and maturation. Assessment of cardiomyocyte metabolism in neonatal mouse heart revealed a myocardial metabolic shift from glycolysis to fatty acid β-oxidation that coincided with the burst of cardiomyocyte cell cycle reactivation and hypertrophic growth. Inhibition of fatty acid β-oxidation metabolism in infant mouse heart delayed cardiomyocyte cell cycle exit, hypertrophic growth and maturation. By contrast, pharmacologic and genetic activation of PPARα, a major regulator of cardiac fatty acid metabolism, induced fatty acid β-oxidation and initially promoted cardiomyocyte proliferation rate in infant mice. As the cell cycle proceeded, activation of PPARα-mediated fatty acid β-oxidation promoted cardiomyocytes hypertrophic growth and maturation, which led to cell cycle exit. As a consequence, activation of PPARα-mediated fatty acid β-oxidation did not alter the total number of cardiomyocytes in infant mice.

Amino acid and cDNA nucleotide sequences have been identified for all of these proteins. CPT1-A deficiency presents as recurrent attacks of fasting hypoketotic hypoglycemia. Twenty four CPT1A mutations have been reported to date. CPT1-B and -C deficiencies have not been hitherto identified. CPT2 deficiency has several clinical presentations. The “benign” adult form (more than 200 families reported) is characterized by episodes of rhabdomyolysis triggered by prolonged exercise. The prevalent S113L mutation is found in about 50% of mutant alleles. The infantile-type CPT2 presents as severe attacks of hypoketotic hypoglycemia, occasionally associated with cardiac damage commonly responsible for sudden death before 1 year of age. In addition to these symptoms, features of brain and kidney dysorganogenesis are frequently seen in the neonatal-onset CPT2 deficiency, almost always lethal during the first month of life. Around 40 CPT2 mutations (private missense or truncating mutations) have hitherto been detected.

We herein described a convenient and quantitative assay to monitor dynamic FAO activities of mammalian cells in physiologically relevant settings. The method enabled us to assess various molecular and pharmacological modulators of the FAO pathway in established cell lines, primary cells and mice. Surprisingly, many previously proposed FAO inhibitors such as ranolazine and trimetazidine lacked FAO-interfering activity. In comparison, etomoxir at low micromolar concentrations was sufficient to saturate its target proteins and to block cellular FAO function. Oxfenicine, on the other hand, acted as a partial inhibitor of FAO. As another class of FAO inhibitors that transcriptionally repress FAO genes, antagonists of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs), particularly that of PPARα, significantly decreased cellular FAO activity. Our assay also had sufficient sensitivity to monitor upregulation of FAO in response to environmental glucose depletion and other energy-demanding cues. Altogether this study provided a reliable FAO assay and a clear picture of biological properties of potential FAO modulators in the mammalian system.",1,10,1450

Infected HS cells and their differentiated descendants maintained long-term and stable retroviral expression after serial adoptive transfers. In addition, retrovirally infected ES cells showed detectable expression level of the green fluorescent protein (GFP). Moreover, GFP expression of integrated proviruses was maintained after in vitro differentiation of infected ES cells. Long-term passage of infected ES cells resulted in methylation-mediated silencing, while short-term expression was methylation independent. Tissues of transgenic animals, which we derived from ES cells carrying the MSCV-based provirus, did not express GFP. However, treatment with the demethylating agent 5-azadeoxycytidine reactivated the silent provirus, demonstrating that DNA methylation is involved in the maintenance of retroviral repression.

Problems in achieving stable transgene expression include multi-copy transgene silencing, chromosome-position effects, and loss of expression during long-term culture, induced cell quiescence, and/or cell differentiation. Previously, we described the “BAC TG-EMBED” method for copy-number dependent, chromosome position-independent expression of embedded transgenes within a BAC containing ~170 kb of the mouse Dhfr locus. Here we demonstrate wider applicability of the method by identifying a BAC and promoter combination that drives reproducible, copy-number dependent, position-independent transgene expression even after induced quiescence and/or cell differentiation into multiple cell types. Using a GAPDH BAC containing ~200 kb of the human GAPDH gene locus and a 1.2 kb human UBC promoter, we achieved stable GFP-ZeoR reporter expression in mouse NIH 3T3 cells after low-serum-induced cell cycle arrest or differentiation into adipocytes. More notably, GFP-ZeoR expression remained stable and copy-number dependent even after differentiation of mouse ESCs into several distinct lineages.

While once considered a distinct cellular state, it is becoming clear that pluripotency is in fact a continuum of cellular states, all capable of self-renewal and differentiation, yet with distinct metabolic, mitochondrial and epigenetic features dependent on gestational stage. In this review we focus on two of the most clearly defined states: “naïve” and “primed” PSCs. Like other rapidly dividing cells, PSCs have a high demand for anabolic precursors necessary to replicate their genome, cytoplasm and organelles, while concurrently consuming energy in the form of ATP. This requirement for both anabolic and catabolic processes sufficient to supply a highly adapted cell cycle in the context of reduced oxygen availability, distinguishes PSCs from their differentiated progeny. During early embryogenesis PSCs adapt their substrate preference to match the bioenergetic requirements of each specific developmental stage. This is reflected in different mitochondrial morphologies, membrane potentials, electron transport chain (ETC) compositions, and utilization of glycolysis. Additionally, metabolites produced in PSCs can directly influence epigenetic and transcriptional programs, which in turn can affect self-renewal characteristics. Thus, our understanding of the role of metabolism in PSC fate has expanded from anabolism and catabolism to include governance of the pluripotent epigenetic landscape. Understanding the roles of metabolism and the factors influencing metabolic pathways in naïve and primed pluripotent states provide a platform for understanding the drivers of cell fate during development. This review highlights the roles of the major metabolic pathways in the acquisition and maintenance of the different states of pluripotency.",,8,87

In this study, we performed mtDNA deep sequencing during the transition from parental fibroblasts to reprogrammed iPSC and to differentiated neuronal precursor cells (NPCs) obtained from controls and patients affected by mitochondrial disorders. At each step, mtDNA variants, including those potentially pathogenic, fluctuate between emerging and disappearing, and some having functional implications.

Such systems would possess the autonomous, adaptive, and self‐healing characteristics of living organisms, but would be engineered with the goal of assembling bulk materials with designer physicochemical or mechanical properties, across multiple length scales. Early efforts toward such engineered living materials (ELMs) are reviewed here, with an emphasis on engineered bacterial systems, living composite materials which integrate inorganic components, successful examples of large‐scale implementation, and production methods. In addition, a conceptual exploration of the fundamental criteria of ELM technology and its future challenges is presented. Cradled within the rich intersection of synthetic biology and self‐assembling materials, the development of ELM technologies allows the power of biology to be leveraged to grow complex structures and objects using a palette of bio‐nanomaterials. Engineered living materials (ELMs) harness cellular processes to assimilate energy, carbon, and other nutrients from their environment into the molecular building blocks of materials and assemble those building blocks into multiscale biomaterials. Relevant fundamental advances in genetic engineering, biosensing, and biomanufacturing are reviewed, in addition to examples of ELMs with autonomous, adaptive, and self‐renewing characteristics.",19,30,1704847

Most microbial species remain uncultivated, and modifying artificial nutrient media brings only an incremental increase in cultivability. We reasoned that an alternative way to cultivate species with unknown requirements is to use naturally occurring combinations of growth factors. To achieve this, we moved cultivation into the microbes' natural habitat by placing cells taken from varying environmental samples into diffusion chambers, which are then returned to nature for incubation. By miniaturizing the chambers and placing only one to several cells into each chamber, we can grow and isolate microorganisms in axenic culture in one step. We call this cultivation platform the 'isolation chip', or 'ichip'. This platform has been shown to increase microbial recovery from 5- to 300-fold, depending on the study. Furthermore, it provides access to a unique set of microbes that are inaccessible by standard cultivation. Here we provide a simple protocol for building and applying ichips for environmental cultivation of soil bacteria as an example; the protocol consists of (i) preparing the ichip; (ii) collecting an environmental sample; (iii) serially diluting cells and loading them into the ichip; (iv) returning the ichip to the environment for incubation; (v) retrieving the ichip and harvesting grown material; and (vi) domestication of the ichip-derived colonies for growth in the laboratory. The ichip's full assembly and deployment is a relatively simple procedure that, with experience, takes ∼2–3 h. After in situ incubation, retrieval of the ichip and processing of its contents will take ∼1–4 h, depending on which specific procedures are used.",10,12,2232-2242

The authors describe the clinical features, genetic causes and pathological mechanisms underlying these diseases, the understanding of which will be key to developing innovative therapies for these patients. Mitochondria are critical organelles for endocrine health; steroid hormone biosynthesis occurs in these organelles and they provide energy in the form of ATP for hormone production and trafficking. Mitochondrial diseases are multisystem disorders that feature defective oxidative phosphorylation, and are characterized by enormous clinical, biochemical and genetic heterogeneity. To date, mitochondrial diseases have been found to result from >250 monogenic defects encoded across two genomes: the nuclear genome and the ancient circular mitochondrial genome located within mitochondria themselves. Endocrine dysfunction is often observed in genetic mitochondrial diseases and reflects decreased intracellular production or extracellular secretion of hormones. Diabetes mellitus is the most frequently described endocrine disturbance in patients with inherited mitochondrial diseases, but other endocrine manifestations in these patients can include growth hormone deficiency, hypogonadism, adrenal dysfunction, hypoparathyroidism and thyroid disease. Although mitochondrial endocrine dysfunction frequently occurs in the context of multisystem disease, some mitochondrial disorders are characterized by isolated endocrine involvement. Furthermore, additional monogenic mitochondrial endocrine diseases are anticipated to be revealed by the application of genome-wide next-generation sequencing approaches in the future. Understanding the mitochondrial basis of endocrine disturbance is key to developing innovative therapies for patients with mitochondrial diseases.",2,13,92-104

In addition, application of mechanical strain to OSCs enhanced association of YAP with muscle-specific cytidine-adenosine-thymidine (MCAT) response elements in the promoter stimulated by retinoic acid gene 8 (Stra8), the transcriptional activation of which is required for germline meiotic commitment.

Such human beta cell populations also diverged in mitochondrial RNA mutational repertoire, and in their selective signature, thus implying the existence of two previously overlooked distinct and conserved beta cell populations. While applying our approach to human alpha cells, two sub-populations of cells were identified which diverged in mtDNA gene expression, yet these cellular populations did not consistently diverge in nDNA OXPHOS genes expression, nor did they correlate with the expression of glucagon, the hallmark of alpha cells.

A greater knowledge of the intricate cellular milieu of the heart is critical to increase our understanding of cardiac homeostasis and pathology. As recent advances in low-input RNA sequencing have allowed definitions of cellular transcriptomes at single-cell resolution at scale, we have applied these approaches to assess the cellular and transcriptional diversity of the nonfailing human heart. Methods: Microfluidic encapsulation and barcoding was used to perform single nuclear RNA sequencing with samples from 7 human donors, selected for their absence of overt cardiac disease. Individual nuclear transcriptomes were then clustered based on transcriptional profiles of highly variable genes. These clusters were used as the basis for between-chamber and between-sex differential gene expression analyses and intersection with genetic and pharmacologic data. Results: We sequenced the transcriptomes of 287 269 single cardiac nuclei, revealing 9 major cell types and 20 subclusters of cell types within the human heart. Cellular subclasses include 2 distinct groups of resident macrophages, 4 endothelial subtypes, and 2 fibroblast subsets. Comparisons of cellular transcriptomes by cardiac chamber or sex reveal diversity not only in cardiomyocyte transcriptional programs but also in subtypes involved in extracellular matrix remodeling and vascularization. Using genetic association data, we identified strong enrichment for the role of cell subtypes in cardiac traits and diseases. Intersection of our data set with genes on cardiac clinical testing panels and the druggable genome reveals striking patterns of cellular specificity. Conclusions: Using large-scale single nuclei RNA sequencing, we defined the transcriptional and cellular diversity in the normal human heart. Our identification of discrete cell subtypes and differentially expressed genes within the heart will ultimately facilitate the development of new therapeutics for cardiovascular diseases.",5,142,466-482

We identified interactors of translocases, respiratory chain, and ATP synthase assembly factors. The abundance of MitoCoP proteins covers six orders of magnitude and amounts to 7% of the cellular proteome with the chaperones HSP60-HSP10 being the most abundant mitochondrial proteins. MitoCoP dynamics spans three orders of magnitudes, with half-lives from hours to months, and suggests a rapid regulation of biosynthesis and assembly processes. 460 MitoCoP genes are linked to human diseases with a strong prevalence for the central nervous system and metabolism.

Progress of this work led to an additional shift from looking for “the mechanism” of aging and formulating the corresponding “theories of aging” to appreciation that aging represents a net result of multiple physiological changes and their intricate interactions. It was also shown that mechanisms of aging include nutrient-dependent signaling pathways which have been remarkably conserved in the course of the evolution. Another important development in this field is increased emphasis on searching for pharmacological and environmental interventions that can extend healthspan or influence other aspects of aging. Progress in understanding the key role of aging as a risk factor for chronic disease provides impetus for these studies. Data from the recent pandemic provided additional evidence for the impact of age on resilience. Progress of work in this area also was influenced by major analytical and technological advances, including greatly improved methods for the study of gene expression, protein, lipids, and metabolites profiles, enhanced ability to produce various genetic modifications and novel approaches to assessment of biological age.

We applied mePRODmt to determine protein uptake kinetics and examined how inhibitors of mitochondrial import machineries affect protein uptake. Monitoring changes in translation and uptake upon mitochondrial membrane depolarization revealed that protein uptake was extensively modulated by the import and translation machineries via activation of the integrated stress response. Strikingly, uptake changes were not uniform, with subsets of proteins being unaffected or decreased due to changes in translation or import capacity."

In vivo, cardiomyocytes undergo numerous adaptive structural, functional and metabolic changes during maturation. By contrast, PSC‐CMs fail to fully undergo these developmental processes, instead remaining arrested at an embryonic stage of maturation. There is thus a significant need to understand the biological processes underlying proper CM maturation in vivo. Here, we discuss what is known regarding the initiation and coordination of CM maturation. We postulate that there is a critical perinatal window, ranging from embryonic day 18.5 to postnatal day 14 in mice, in which the maturation process is exquisitely sensitive to perturbation. While the initiation mechanisms of this process are unknown, it is increasingly clear that maturation proceeds through interconnected regulatory circuits that feed into one another to coordinate concomitant structural, functional and metabolic CM maturation. We highlight PGC1α, SRF and the MEF2 family as transcription factors that may potentially mediate this cross‐talk. We lastly discuss several emerging technologies that will facilitate future studies into the mechanisms of CM maturation. Further study will not only produce a better understanding of its key processes, but provide practical insights into developing a robust strategy to produce mature PSC‐CMs. Here, we postulate that there is a critical window, ranging from embryonic day 18.5 to postnatal day 14 in mice, in which interconnected regulatory circuits enable coordinated, concomitant structural, functional and metabolic cardiomyocyte maturation.",14,598,2941-2956

Fon",Journal of Proteome Research,,,J Proteome Res,1535-3893,"The generation of mitochondrial-derived vesicles (MDVs) is implicated in a plethora of vital cell functions, from mitochondrial quality control to peroxisomal biogenesis. The discovery of distinct subtypes of MDVs has revealed the selective inclusion of mitochondrial cargo in response to varying stimuli. However, the true scope and variety of MDVs is currently unclear, and unbiased approaches have yet to be used to understand their biology. Furthermore, as mitochondrial dysfunction has been implicated in many neurodegenerative diseases, it is essential to understand MDV pathways in the nervous system. To address this, we sought to identify the cargo in brain MDVs. We used an in vitro budding assay and proteomic approach to identify proteins selectively enriched in MDVs. 72 proteins were identified as MDV-enriched, of which 31% were OXPHOS proteins. Interestingly, the OXPHOS proteins localized to specific modules of the respiratory complexes, hinting at the inclusion of sub-assemblies in MDVs. Small TIM chaperones were also highly enriched in MDVs, linking mitochondrial chaperone-mediated protein transport to MDV formation. As the two Parkinson’s disease genes PINK1 and Parkin have been previously implicated in MDV biogenesis in response to oxidative stress, we compared the MDV proteomes from the brains of wild-type mice with those of PINK1‑/‑ and Parkin‑/‑ mice. No significant difference was found, suggesting that PINK1- and Parkin-dependent MDVs make up a small proportion of all MDVs in the brain. Our findings demonstrate a previously uncovered landscape of MDV complexity and provide a foundation from which further novel MDV functions can be discovered.

Such strategies reduce cardiac I/R injury by activating protective signaling pathways that prevent the exacerbated production of reactive oxygen/nitrogen species, inhibit opening of mitochondrial permeability transition pore and reduce apoptosis, maintaining normal mitochondrial function. Cardioprotection also involves the activation of mitochondrial quality control (MQC) processes, which replace defective mitochondria or eliminate mitochondrial debris, preserving the structure and function of the network of these organelles, and consequently ensuring homeostasis and survival of cardiomyocytes. Such processes include mitochondrial biogenesis, fission, fusion, mitophagy and mitochondrial-controlled cell death. This review updates recent advances in MQC mechanisms that are activated in the protection conferred by different cardiac conditioning interventions. Furthermore, the role of extracellular vesicles in mitochondrial protection and turnover of these organelles will be discussed.

Exosomes and microvesicles have same membrane orientation, different yet overlapping sizes; their cargo contents are selectively packed and dependent on the source cell type and functional state. Both exosomes and microvesicles can transfer bioactive RNAs, proteins, lipids, and metabolites from donor to recipient cells and influence the biological properties of the latter. Over the last decade, their potential roles as effective inter-tissue communicators in cardiovascular physiology and pathology have been increasingly appreciated. In addition, EVs are attractive sources of biomarkers for the diagnosis and prognosis of diseases, because they acquire their complex cargoes through cellular processes intimately linked to disease pathogenesis.

After the exposure to the examined conditions, the expression of genes related to pro- and anti- inflammatory factors was evaluated and compared to the secretion of selected cytokines by ELISA test. Moreover, the changes in LESC phenotype were assessed using of phenotype microarrays.

Muscle phosphocreatine, ATP, and ATP/AMP ratios were all markedly decreased and led to the activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) in the β-GPA-fed rats compared with control rats. Under these conditions, nuclear respiratory factor-1 (NRF-1) binding activity, measured using a cDNA probe containing a sequence encoding for the promoter of δ-aminolevulinate (ALA) synthase, was increased by about eightfold in the muscle of β-GPA-fed rats compared with the control group. Concomitantly, muscle ALA synthase mRNA and cytochrome ccontent were also increased. Mitochondrial density in both extensor digitorum longus and epitrochlearis from β-GPA-fed rats was also increased by more than twofold compared with the control group. In conclusion, chronic phosphocreatine depletion during β-GPA supplementation led to the activation of muscle AMPK that was associated with increased NRF-1 binding activity, increased cytochromec content, and increased muscle mitochondrial density.

Resveratrol significantly reduced sleeping and resting metabolic rate. In muscle, resveratrol activated AMPK, increased SIRT1 and PGC-1α protein levels, increased citrate synthase activity without change in mitochondrial content, and improved muscle mitochondrial respiration on a fatty acid-derived substrate. Furthermore, resveratrol elevated intramyocellular lipid levels and decreased intrahepatic lipid content, circulating glucose, triglycerides, alanine-aminotransferase, and inflammation markers. Systolic blood pressure dropped and HOMA index improved after resveratrol. In the postprandial state, adipose tissue lipolysis and plasma fatty acid and glycerol decreased. In conclusion, we demonstrate that 30 days of resveratrol supplementation induces metabolic changes in obese humans, mimicking the effects of calorie restriction.",5,14,612-622

In these organisms, lifespan extension is dependent on Sir2, a conserved deacetylase proposed to underlie the beneficial effects of caloric restriction. Here we show that resveratrol shifts the physiology of middle-aged mice on a high-calorie diet towards that of mice on a standard diet and significantly increases their survival. Resveratrol produces changes associated with longer lifespan, including increased insulin sensitivity, reduced insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-I) levels, increased AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ coactivator 1α (PGC-1α) activity, increased mitochondrial number, and improved motor function. Parametric analysis of gene set enrichment revealed that resveratrol opposed the effects of the high-calorie diet in 144 out of 153 significantly altered pathways.

Promoting mitochondrial biogenesis (MB) as a repair mechanism after injury may offer a unique strategy to restore both mitochondrial and organ function. Rats subjected to bilateral renal pedicle ligation for 22min were treated once daily with the SIRT1 activator SRT1720 (5mg/kg) starting 24h after reperfusion until 72h–144h. SIRT1 expression was elevated in the renal cortex of rats after I/R+vehicle treatment (IRV), but was associated with less nuclear localization. SIRT1 expression was even further augmented and nuclear localization was restored in the kidneys of rats after I/R+SRT1720 treatment (IRS). PGC-1α was elevated at 72h–144h in IRV and IRS kidneys; however, SRT1720 treatment induced deacetylation of PGC-1α, a marker of activation. Mitochondrial proteins ATP synthase β, COX I, and NDUFB8, as well as mitochondrial respiration, were diminished 24h–144h in IRV rats, but were partially or fully restored in IRS rats. Urinary kidney injury molecule-1 (KIM-1) was persistently elevated in both IRV and IRS rats; however, KIM-1 tissue expression was attenuated in IRS rats. Additionally, sustained loss of Na+,K+–ATPase expression and basolateral localization and elevated vimentin in IRV rats was normalized in IRS rats, suggesting restoration of a differentiated, polarized tubule epithelium. The results suggest that SRT1720 treatment expedited recovery of mitochondrial protein expression and function by enhancing MB, which was associated with faster proximal tubule repair.

These mitochondrial enzymes regulate the level of catecholamines and serotonin by catalyzing their oxidative deamination in the heart. MAOs’ expression substantially increases with ageing (6-fold MAO-A in the heart and 4-fold MAO-B in neuronal tissue), and their involvement in cardiac diseases is supposedly related to the formation of ROS, via the hydrogen peroxide produced during the substrate degradation.

The mitochondria cristae development status and their localization patterns determine the oxygen consumption rate and ATP production which is a central controller of stem cell maintenance and differentiation. Generally, stem cells show spherical, immature mitochondria with perinuclear distribution. Such mitochondria are metabolically less energetic and low polarized. Moreover, mostly glycolytic energy production is found in pluripotent stem cells with a variation in naïve stem cells which perform oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS).

Increased heterogeneity has been demonstrated in a number of disease models including ischemia-reperfusion and nutrient-induced beta cell dysfunction and diabetes. Subcellular location and proximity to other organelles, as well as uneven distribution of respiratory components have been considered as the main contributors to the basal level of heterogeneity. Recent studies point to mitochondrial dynamics and autophagy as major regulators of mitochondrial heterogeneity. While mitochondrial fusion mixes the content of the mitochondrial network, fission dissects the mitochondrial network and generates depolarized segments. These depolarized mitochondria are segregated from the networking population, forming a pre-autophagic pool contributing to heterogeneity. The capacity of a network to yield a depolarized daughter mitochondrion by a fission event is fundamental to the generation of heterogeneity. Several studies and data presented here provide a potential explanation, suggesting that protein and membranous structures are unevenly distributed within the individual mitochondrion and that inner membrane components do not mix during a fusion event to the same extent as the matrix components do. In conclusion, mitochondrial subcellular heterogeneity is a reflection of the mitochondrial lifecycle that involves frequent fusion events in which components may be unevenly mixed and followed by fission events generating disparate daughter mitochondria, some of which may fuse again, others will remain solitary and join a pre-autophagic pool.",10,41,1914-1927

However, the interplay among these various roles of mitochondria is still poorly understood, and the underlying mechanisms can be related to system level properties. Importantly, mitochondria localized in different regions of a cell may display different morphology, dissimilar biochemical properties, or may differently interact with other intracellular structures. Recent advances in live imaging techniques have also revealed a functional heterogeneity of mitochondria with respect to mitochondrial redox state, membrane potential, respiratory activity, uncoupling proteins, mitochondrial ROS and calcium. An important and still unresolved question is how the heterogeneity of mitochondrial function and the regional specializations of mitochondria are mechanistically realized in the cell and to what extent this could be dependent on environmental aspects. Distinct mitochondrial subsets may also exhibit different responses to substrates and inhibitors and may vary in their sensitivity to pathology, resistance to apoptosis, oxidative stress, thus also demonstrating heterogeneous behavior. All these observations strongly suggest that the intracellular position, organization and the specific surroundings of mitochondria within the cell define their functional features, while also implying that different mitochondrial subpopulations, clusters or even single mitochondrion may execute diverse processes in a cell.

Genetic suppression of chromosomal instability markedly delays metastasis even in highly aneuploid tumour models, whereas continuous chromosome segregation errors promote cellular invasion and metastasis in a STING-dependent manner. By subverting lethal epithelial responses to cytosolic DNA, chromosomally unstable tumour cells co-opt chronic activation of innate immune pathways to spread to distant organs. In chromosomally unstable tumour cells, rupture of micronuclei exposes genomic DNA and activates the cGAS–STING cytosolic DNA-sensing pathway, thereby promoting metastasis. The cGAS–STING cytosolic DNA-sensing pathway detects the presence of double-stranded DNA in the cytosol of cells, which triggers an inflammatory response. This pathway can be activated by foreign or cellular DNA. Lewis Cantley and colleagues show that the pathway is activated in human cancer cells with chromosomal instability. Improper segregation of chromosomes during cell division leads to the formation of unstable micronuclei, which burst and release their DNA into the cytosol. The resulting inflammatory response involves activation of NF-κB signalling and promotes metastasis in a STING-dependent manner. These findings link chromosomal instability to metastasis and may offer new avenues to preventing the spread of cancer to distant organs.",7689,553,467-472

How tumors co-opt inflammatory signaling while evading immune surveillance remains unknown. Here, we show that the ectonucleotidase ENPP1 promotes metastasis by selectively degrading extracellular cGAMP, an immune-stimulatory metabolite whose breakdown products include the immune suppressor adenosine. ENPP1 loss suppresses metastasis, restores tumor immune infiltration, and potentiates response to immune checkpoint blockade in a manner dependent on tumor cGAS and host STING. Conversely, overexpression of wild-type ENPP1, but not an enzymatically weakened mutant, promotes migration and metastasis, in part through the generation of extracellular adenosine, and renders otherwise sensitive tumors completely resistant to immunotherapy. In human cancers, ENPP1 expression correlates with reduced immune cell infiltration, increased metastasis, and resistance to anti–PD-1/PD-L1 treatment. Thus, cGAMP hydrolysis by ENPP1 enables chromosomally unstable tumors to transmute cGAS activation into an immune-suppressive pathway. Significance: Chromosomal instability promotes metastasis by generating chronic tumor inflammation. ENPP1 facilitates metastasis and enables tumor cells to tolerate inflammation by hydrolyzing the immunotransmitter cGAMP, preventing its transfer from cancer cells to immune cells.

Single-cell sequencing revealed that these resistant populations develop recurrent aneuploidies, and independently deriving one chromosome-loss event that was frequently observed in paclitaxel-resistant cells was sufficient to decrease paclitaxel sensitivity. Finally, we demonstrated that intrinsic levels of CIN correlate with poor responses to numerous therapies in human tumors.

Atypical Parkinsonism comprises approximately 20% of all patients with parkinsonism. Progressive Supranuclear Palsy (PSP) belongs to the atypical parkinsonian diseases and is histopathologically classified as a tauopathy. Here, we report that mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) derived from the bone marrow of patients with PSP exhibit mitochondrial dysfunction in the form of decreased membrane potential and inhibited NADH-dependent respiration. Furthermore, mitochondrial dysfunction in PSP-MSCs led to a significant increase in mitochondrial ROS generation and oxidative stress, which resulted in decrease of major cellular antioxidant GSH. Additionally, higher basal rate of mitochondrial degradation and lower levels of biogenesis were found in PSP-MSCs, together leading to a reduction in mitochondrial mass. This phenotype was biologically relevant to MSC stemness properties, as it heavily impaired their differentiation into adipocytes, which mostly rely on mitochondrial metabolism for their bioenergetic demand. The defect in adipogenic differentiation was detected as a significant impairment of intracellular lipid droplet formation in PSP-MSCs. This result was corroborated at the transcriptional level by a significant reduction of PPARγ and FABP4 expression, two key genes involved in the adipogenic molecular network. Our findings in PSP-MSCs provide new insights into the etiology of ‘idiopathic’ parkinsonism, and confirm that mitochondrial dysfunction is important to the development of parkinsonism, independent of the type of the cell.",,14,474-484

PCs reside in proximity to Lgr5+ intestinal stem cells (ISC) and mitochondria are critical for ISC-renewal and differentiation. Here, we characterise ISC and PC appearance under inflammatory conditions and describe the role of mitochondrial function for ISC niche-maintenance. Ileal tissue samples from patients with CD, mouse models for mitochondrial dysfunction (Hsp60Δ/ΔISC) and CD-like ileitis (TNFΔARE), and intestinal organoids were used to characterise PCs and ISCs in relation to mitochondrial function. In patients with CD and TNFΔARE mice, inflammation correlated with reduced numbers of Lysozyme-positive granules in PCs and decreased Lgr5 expression in crypt regions. Disease-associated changes in PC and ISC appearance persisted in non-inflamed tissue regions of patients with CD and predicted the risk of disease recurrence after surgical resection. ISC-specific deletion of Hsp60 and inhibition of mitochondrial respiration linked mitochondrial function to the aberrant PC phenotype. Consistent with reduced stemness in vivo, crypts from inflamed TNFΔARE mice fail to grow into organoids ex vivo. Dichloroacetate-mediated inhibition of glycolysis, forcing cells to shift to mitochondrial respiration, improved ISC niche function and rescued the ability of TNFΔARE mice-derived crypts to form organoids. We provide evidence that inflammation-associated mitochondrial dysfunction in the intestinal epithelium triggers a metabolic imbalance, causing reduced stemness and acquisition of a dysfunctional PC phenotype.

For primary skeletal muscle satellite cells, inhibition of differentiation was observed in palmitic acid‐induced insulin resistance model. Moreover, enhanced myoblast differentiation increased glucose uptake and insulin sensitivity. These findings indicate that pre‐diabetes result in mitochondrial dysfunction and inhibition of myoblast differentiation in skeletal muscle.

Emerging research revealed the essential role of mitochondria in regulating stem/progenitor cell differentiation of neural progenitor cells, mesenchymal stem cells and other stem cells through reactive oxygen species (ROS), Notch or other signaling pathway. Inhibition of mitochondrial protein synthesis results in hair loss upon injury. However, alteration of mitochondrial morphology and metabolic function during hair follicle stem cells (HFSCs) differentiation and how they affect hair regeneration has not been elaborated upon. Methods. We compared the difference in mitochondrial morphology and activity between telogen bulge cells and anagen matrix cells. Expression levels of mitochondrial ROS and superoxide dismutase 2 (SOD2) were measured to evaluate redox balance. In addition, the level of pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDK) and pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) were estimated to present the change in energetic metabolism during differentiation. To explore the effect of the mitochondrial metabolism on regulating hair regeneration, hair growth was observed after application of a mitochondrial respiratory inhibitor upon hair plucking. Results. During HFSCs differentiation, mitochondria became elongated with more abundant organized cristae and showed higher activity in differentiated cells. SOD2 was enhanced for redox balance with relatively stable ROS levels in differentiated cells. PDK increased in HFSCs while differentiated cells showed enhanced PDH, indicating that respiration switched from glycolysis to oxidative phosphorylation during differentiation. Inhibiting mitochondrial respiration in differentiated hair follicle cells upon hair plucking repressed hair regeneration in vivo. Conclusions. Upon HFSCs differentiation, mitochondria are elongated with more abundant cristae and show higher activity, accompanying with activated aerobic respiration in differentiated cells for higher energy supply. Also, dysfunction of mitochondrial respiration delays hair regeneration upon injury.",,4,e1821

During osteogenic and adipogenic differentiation, BM-MSCs show a preference for glycolysis during proliferation but shift to an oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhos)-dependent metabolism. The MSC immunoregulatory fate is achieved with cell polarization, and the result is sustained production of immunoregulatory molecules (including PGE2, HGF, IL1RA, IL6, IL8, IDO activity) in response to inflammatory stimuli. MSCs adapt their energetic metabolism when acquiring immunomodulatory property and shift to aerobic glycolysis. This can be achieved via hypoxia, pretreatment with small molecule-metabolic mediators such as oligomycin, or AKT/mTOR pathway modulation. The immunoregulatory effect of MSC on macrophages polarization and Th17 switch is related to the glycolytic status of the MSC. Indeed, MSCs pretreated with oligomycin decreased the M1/M2 ratio, inhibited T-CD4 proliferation, and prevented Th17 switch. Mitochondrial activity also impacts MSC metabolism. In the bone marrow, MSCs are present in a quiescent, low proliferation, but they keep their multi-progenitor function. In this stage, they appear to be glycolytic with active mitochondria (MT) status. During MSC expansion, we observed a metabolic shift toward OXPhos, coupled with an increased MT activity. An increased production of ROS and dysfunctional mitochondria is associated with the metabolic shift to glycolysis. In contrast, when MSC underwent chondro or osteoblast differentiation, they showed a decreased glycolysis and inhibition of the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP). In parallel the mitochondrial enzymatic activities increased associated with oxidative phosphorylation enhancement. MSCs respond to damaged or inflamed tissue through the transfer of MT to injured and immune cells, conveying a type of signaling that contributes to the restoration of cell homeostasis and immune function. The delivery of MT into injured cells increased ATP levels which in turn maintained cellular bioenergetics and recovered cell functions. MSC-derived MT may be transferred via tunneling nanotubes to undifferentiated cardiomyocytes and leading to their maturation. In this review, we will decipher the pathways and the mechanisms responsible for mitochondria transfer and activity. The eventual reversal of the metabolic and pro-inflammatory profile induced by the MT transfer will open new avenues for the control of inflammatory diseases.",,12,606781

Quiescent NSPCs show high levels of carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1a (Cpt1a)-dependent FAO, which is downregulated in proliferating NSPCs. Pharmacological inhibition and conditional deletion of Cpt1a in vitro and in vivo leads to altered NSPC behavior, showing that Cpt1a-dependent FAO is required for stem cell maintenance and proper neurogenesis. Strikingly, manipulation of malonyl-CoA, the metabolite that regulates levels of FAO, is sufficient to induce exit from quiescence and to enhance NSPC proliferation.

However, the molecular and physiological requirements for germline stem cell homeostasis remain largely elusive. Here, we report that mitochondrial biogenesis and function are crucial for germline stem cell identity. We show that general transcription activity in germline mitochondria is highly compartmentalized, and determines mitochondrial maturation. RPOM-1, the mitochondrial RNA polymerase, is differentially expressed as germ nuclei progress from the distal to the proximal gonad arm to form oocytes. Mitochondria undergo changes from globular to tubular morphology and become polarized, as they approach the proximal gonad arm. Notably, this mitochondrial maturation trajectory is evolutionarily conserved. We find that a similar transition and temporal mitochondrial RNA polymerase expression profile characterizes differentiation of mammalian stem cells. In C. elegans, ATP, and ROS production increases sharply during maturation. Impaired mitochondrial bioenergetics causes gonad syncytium tumor formation by disrupting the balance between mitosis and differentiation to oocytes, which results in a marked reduction of fecundity. Consequently, compensatory apoptosis is induced in the germline. Sperm-derived signals promote mitochondrial maturation and proper germ cell differentiation via the MEK/ERK kinase pathway. Germ cell fate decisions are determined by a crosstalk between Insulin/IGF-1 and TGF-β signaling, mitochondria and protein synthesis. Our findings demonstrate that mitochondrial transcription activity determines a shift in mitochondrial bioenergetics, which in turn regulates germline stem cell survival and differentiation. Perturbation of mitochondrial transcription hinders proper germ cell differentiation and causes germline tumor development.",2,27,601-617

However, it is uncertain whether and how heteroplasmic mtDNA mutations affect particular cellular fate-determination processes, which are closely associated with the cell-type-specific pathophysiology of mitochondrial diseases. In this study, we established two isogenic induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) lines each carrying different proportions of a heteroplasmic m.3243A>G mutation from the same patient; one exhibited apparently normal and the other showed most likely impaired mitochondrial respiratory function. Low proportions of m.3243A>G exhibited no apparent molecular pathogenic influence on directed differentiation into neurons and cardiomyocytes, whereas high proportions of m.3243A>G showed both induced neuronal cell death and inhibited cardiac lineage commitment. Such neuronal and cardiac maturation defects were also confirmed using another patient-derived iPSC line carrying quite high proportion of m.3243A>G. In conclusion, mitochondrial respiratory dysfunction strongly inhibits maturation and survival of iPSC-derived neurons and cardiomyocytes; our presenting data also suggest that appropriate mitochondrial maturation actually contributes to cellular fate-determination processes during development.",1,8,e2551

Nonetheless, the mechanisms and regulation of superoxide and hydrogen peroxide formation by mitochondria remain poorly described. Measurement of the capacities of different sites of superoxide and hydrogen peroxide production in isolated skeletal muscle mitochondria show that the maximum capacities of sites in complexes I, II and III and in several associated redox enzymes greatly exceed the native rates observed in the absence of respiratory chain inhibitors. In vitro, the native rates and the relative importance of different sites both depend on the substrate being oxidized, with sites IQ, IIF, GPDH, IF and IIIQo each being important with particular substrates.

These studies, combined with the unique evolutionary origin of the mitochondria, led the way to decades of research focusing on the organelle as an essential, yet independent, functional component of the cell. Recently, however, our conceptual view of this isolated organelle has been profoundly altered with the discovery that mitochondria function within an integrated reticulum that is continually remodeled by both fusion and fission events. The identification of a number of proteins that regulate these activities is beginning to provide mechanistic details of mitochondrial membrane remodeling. However, the broader question remains regarding the underlying purpose of mitochondrial dynamics and the translation of these morphological transitions into altered functional output. One hypothesis has been that mitochondrial respiration and metabolism may be spatially and temporally regulated by the architecture and positioning of the organelle. Recent evidence supports and expands this idea by demonstrating that mitochondria are an integral part of multiple cell signaling cascades. Interestingly, proteins such as GTPases, kinases and phosphatases are involved in bi-directional communication between the mitochondrial reticulum and the rest of the cell. These proteins link mitochondrial function and dynamics to the regulation of metabolism, cell-cycle control, development, antiviral responses and cell death. In this review we will highlight the emerging evidence that provides molecular definition to mitochondria as a central platform in the execution of diverse cellular events.",14,16,R551-60,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16860735

Using laser scanning confocal microscopy, mitochondrial transfer via a tunneling nanotube-like structure was detected between mesenchymal stem cells and human umbilical vein endothelial cells. Oxygen glucose deprivation and reoxygenation were performed on human umbilical vein endothelial cells, which induced mitochondrial transfer through tunneling nanotube-like structures to become frequent and almost unidirectional from mesenchymal stem cells to injured endothelial cells, thereby resulting in the rescue of aerobic respiration and protection of endothelial cells from apoptosis.

Although the majority of HERVs have functional gene defects or epigenetic modifications, many of them are still able to produce retroviral proteins that have been proposed to be involved in cellular transformation and cancer development. We found that, in chemo-resistant U87RETO glioblastoma cells, cytotoxic stress induced by etoposide promotes accumulation and large-scale fission of mitochondria, associated with the detection of HERV-WE1 (syncytin-1) and HERV-FRD1 (syncytin-2) in these organelles. In addition, mitochondrial preparations also contained the corresponding receptors, i.e. ASCT2 and MFSD2. We clearly demonstrated that mitochondria associated with HERV-proteins were shuttled between adjacent cancer cells not only via tunneling tubes, but also by direct cellular uptake across the cell membrane. Furthermore, anti-syncytin-1 and anti-syncytin-2 antibodies were able to specifically block this direct cellular uptake of mitochondria even more than antibodies targeting the cognate receptors. Here, we suggest that the association of mitochondria with syncytin-1/syncytin-2 together with their respective receptors could represent a novel mechanism of cell-to-cell transfer. In chemotherapy-refractory cancer cells, this might open up attractive avenues to novel mitochondria-targeting therapies.",56,8,95945-95964,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29221178

Jahar Bhattacharya and colleagues now show that one way these cells offer such protection is to transfer their mitochondria to the injured lung epithelia to improve the bioenergetics of the recipient cells, thus probably allowing them to recover from injury more efficiently. Bone marrow–derived stromal cells (BMSCs) protect against acute lung injury (ALI). To determine the role of BMSC mitochondria in this protection, we airway-instilled mice first with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and then with either mouse BMSCs (mBMSCs) or human BMSCs (hBMSCs). Live optical studies revealed that the mBMSCs formed connexin 43 (Cx43)-containing gap junctional channels (GJCs) with the alveolar epithelia in these mice, releasing mitochondria-containing microvesicles that the epithelia engulfed. The presence of BMSC-derived mitochondria in the epithelia was evident optically, as well as by the presence of human mitochondrial DNA in mouse lungs instilled with hBMSCs. The mitochondrial transfer resulted in increased alveolar ATP concentrations. LPS-induced ALI, as indicated by alveolar leukocytosis and protein leak, inhibition of surfactant secretion and high mortality, was markedly abrogated by the instillation of wild-type mBMSCs but not of mutant, GJC-incompetent mBMSCs or mBMSCs with dysfunctional mitochondria. This is the first evidence, to our knowledge, that BMSCs protect against ALI by restituting alveolar bioenergetics through Cx43-dependent alveolar attachment and mitochondrial transfer.",5,18,759-65,eng

However, their underlying mechanisms remain to be fully defined. Recent experimental studies suggest that mitochondria may be released and transferred between cells. In this proof‐of‐concept study, we asked whether beneficial effects of EPCs may partly involve a mitochondrial phenomenon as well. First, EPC‐derived conditioned medium was collected and divided into supernatant and particle fractions after centrifugation. Electron microscopy, Western blots, and flow cytometry showed that EPCs were able to release mitochondria. ATP and oxygen consumption assays suggested that these extracellular mitochondria may still be functionally viable. Confocal microscopy confirmed that EPC‐derived extracellular mitochondria can be incorporated into normal brain endothelial cells. Adding EPC particles to brain endothelial cells promoted angiogenesis and decreased the permeability of brain endothelial cells. Next, we asked whether EPC‐derived mitochondria may be protective. As expected, oxygen–glucose deprivation (OGD) increased brain endothelial permeability. Adding EPC‐derived mitochondria particles to the damaged brain endothelium increased levels of mitochondrial protein TOM40, mitochondrial DNA copy number, and intracellular ATP. Along with these indirect markers of mitochondrial transfer, endothelial tightness was also restored after OGD. Taken together, these findings suggest that EPCs may support brain endothelial energetics, barrier integrity, and angiogenic function partly through extracellular mitochondrial transfer.

Although their existence and functions in animal organisms are still elusive, emerging evidence suggests that they are involved in developmental processes, tissue regeneration, viral infections or pathogen transfer, stem cell differentiation, immune responses as well as initiation and progression of neurodegenerative disorders and cancer (see Sisakhtnezhad & Khosravi 2015 Eur. J. Cell Biol. 94, 429–443. (doi:10.1016/j.ejcb.2015.06.010)). A broader field of vision, including their striking functional and structural resemblance with nanotube-mediated phenomena found throughout the phylogenetic tree, from plants down to bacteria, points to a universal, conserved and tightly regulated mechanism of cellular assemblies. Based on our initial definition of TNTs as open-ended channels mediating membrane continuity between connected cells (Rustom et al. 2004 Science 303, 1007–1010. (doi:10.1126/science.1093133)), it is suggested that animal tissues represent supercellular assemblies that—besides opening discrete communication pathways—balance diverse stress factors caused by pathological changes or fluctuating physiological and environmental conditions, such as oxidative stress or nutrient shortage. By combining current knowledge about nanotube formation, intercellular transfer and communication phenomena as well as associated molecular pathways, a model evolves, predicting that the linkage between reactive oxygen species, TNT-based supercellularity and the intercellular shuttling of materials will have significant impact on diverse body functions, such as cell survival, redox/metabolic homeostasis and mitochondrial heteroplasmy. It implies that TNTs are intimately linked to the physiological and pathological state of animal cells and represent a central joint element of diverse diseases, such as neurodegenerative disorders, diabetes or cancer.",6,6,160057,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27278648

Methods Homogenesis of mitochondria (wild-type mitochondria) isolated from normal donor cells with about 83.5% preserved activity were delivered into MERRF fibroblasts by Pep-1 conjugation (Pep-1-Mito). Results Delivered doses of 52.5 μg and 105 μg Pep-1-Mito had better delivered efficiency and mitochondrial biogenesis after 15 days of treatment. The recovery of mitochondrial function in deficient cells receiving 3 days of treatment with peptide-mediated mitochondrial delivery was comprehensively demonstrated by restoration of oxidative phosphorylation subunits (complex I, III and IV), mitochondrial membrane potential, adenosine triphosphate synthesis and reduction of reactive oxygen species production. The benefits of enhanced mitochondrial regulation depended on the function of foreign mitochondria and not the existence of mitochondrial DNA and can be maintained for at least 21 days with dramatically elongated mitochondrial morphology. In contrast to delivery of wild-type mitochondria, the specific regulation of Pep-1-Mito during MERRF syndrome progression in cells treated with mutant mitochondria was reflected by the opposite performance, with increase in reactive oxygen species production and matrix metalloproteinase activity.

Here we demonstrate that mitochondria can be transformed into recipient cells very quickly, and co-localize with endogenous mitochondria. The isolated mitochondria interact directly with cells, which engulf the mitochondria with cellular extensions in a way, which may suggest the involvement of macropinocytosis or macropinocytosis-like mechanisms in mitochondrial transformation. Indeed, macropinocytosis inhibitors but not clathrin-mediated endocytosis inhibition-treatments, blocks mitochondria transformation. The integrity of the mitochondrial outer membrane and its proteins is essential for the transformation of the mitochondria into cells; cells can distinguish mitochondria from similar particles and transform only intact mitochondria.

PINK1 is constitutively degraded by an unknown mechanism and stabilized selectively on damaged mitochondria where it can recruit the E3 ligase PARK2/PARKIN to induce mitophagy. Here, we show that, under steady-state conditions, endogenous PINK1 is constitutively and rapidly degraded by E3 ubiquitin ligases UBR1, UBR2 and UBR4 through the N-end rule pathway. Following precursor import into mitochondria, PINK1 is cleaved in the transmembrane segment by a mitochondrial intramembrane protease PARL generating an N-terminal destabilizing amino acid and then retrotranslocates from mitochondria to the cytosol for N-end recognition and proteasomal degradation. Thus, sequential actions of mitochondrial import, PARL-processing, retrotranslocation and recognition by N-end rule E3 enzymes for the ubiquitin proteosomal degradation defines the rapid PINK1 turnover. PINK1 steady-state elimination by the N-end rule identifies a novel organelle to cytoplasm turnover pathway that yields a mechanism to flag damaged mitochondria for autophagic elimination.",11,9,1758-1769

Using mass spectrometry, we discovered that endogenous PINK1 phosphorylated ubiquitin at serine 65, homologous to the site phosphorylated by PINK1 in Parkin’s ubiquitin-like domain.

The small protein ubiquitin, familiar for its role in post-translational modification of other proteins by binding to them and regulating their activity or stability, is shown here to be the substrate of the kinase PINK1, which together with the ubiquitin ligase parkin is a causal gene for hereditary recessive Parkinsonism. Noriyuki Matsuda and colleagues show that following a decrease in mitochondrial membrane potential, PINK1 phosphorylates ubiquitin at serine residue 65; the phosphorylated ubiquitin then interacts with parkin, which is also phosphorylated by PINK1. This interaction allows full activation of parkin enzymatic activity, which involves tagging mitochondrial substrates with ubiquitin. PINK1 (PTEN induced putative kinase 1) and PARKIN (also known as PARK2) have been identified as the causal genes responsible for hereditary recessive early-onset Parkinsonism1,2. PINK1 is a Ser/Thr kinase that specifically accumulates on depolarized mitochondria, whereas parkin is an E3 ubiquitin ligase that catalyses ubiquitin transfer to mitochondrial substrates3,4,5. PINK1 acts as an upstream factor for parkin6,7 and is essential both for the activation of latent E3 parkin activity8 and for recruiting parkin onto depolarized mitochondria8,9,10,11,12. Recently, mechanistic insights into mitochondrial quality control mediated by PINK1 and parkin have been revealed3,4,5, and PINK1-dependent phosphorylation of parkin has been reported13,14,15. However, the requirement of PINK1 for parkin activation was not bypassed by phosphomimetic parkin mutation15, and how PINK1 accelerates the E3 activity of parkin on damaged mitochondria is still obscure. Here we report that ubiquitin is the genuine substrate of PINK1. PINK1 phosphorylated ubiquitin at Ser 65 both in vitro and in cells, and a Ser 65 phosphopeptide derived from endogenous ubiquitin was only detected in cells in the presence of PINK1 and following a decrease in mitochondrial membrane potential. Unexpectedly, phosphomimetic ubiquitin bypassed PINK1-dependent activation of a phosphomimetic parkin mutant in cells. Furthermore, phosphomimetic ubiquitin accelerates discharge of the thioester conjugate formed by UBCH7 (also known as UBE2L3) and ubiquitin (UBCH7∼ubiquitin) in the presence of parkin in vitro, indicating that it acts allosterically. The phosphorylation-dependent interaction between ubiquitin and parkin suggests that phosphorylated ubiquitin unlocks autoinhibition of the catalytic cysteine. Our results show that PINK1-dependent phosphorylation of both parkin and ubiquitin is sufficient for full activation of parkin E3 activity. These findings demonstrate that phosphorylated ubiquitin is a parkin activator.",7503,510,162-166

Muqit",Biochemical Journal,,,Biochem J,0264-6021,"We have previously reported that the Parkinson's disease-associated kinase PINK1 (PTEN-induced putative kinase 1) is activated by mitochondrial depolarization and stimulates the Parkin E3 ligase by phosphorylating Ser65 within its Ubl (ubiquitin-like) domain. Using phosphoproteomic analysis, we identified a novel ubiquitin phosphopeptide phosphorylated at Ser65 that was enriched 14-fold in HEK (human embryonic kidney)-293 cells overexpressing wild-type PINK1 stimulated with the mitochondrial uncoupling agent CCCP (carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone), to activate PINK1, compared with cells expressing kinase-inactive PINK1. Ser65 in ubiquitin lies in a similar motif to Ser65 in the Ubl domain of Parkin. Remarkably, PINK1 directly phosphorylates Ser65 of ubiquitin in vitro. We undertook a series of experiments that provide striking evidence that Ser65-phosphorylated ubiquitin (ubiquitinPhospho−Ser65) functions as a critical activator of Parkin. First, we demonstrate that a fragment of Parkin lacking the Ubl domain encompassing Ser65 (ΔUbl-Parkin) is robustly activated by ubiquitinPhospho−Ser65, but not by non-phosphorylated ubiquitin. Secondly, we find that the isolated Parkin Ubl domain phosphorylated at Ser65 (UblPhospho−Ser65) can also activate ΔUbl-Parkin similarly to ubiquitinPhospho−Ser65. Thirdly, we establish that ubiquitinPhospho−Ser65, but not non-phosphorylated ubiquitin or UblPhospho−Ser65, activates full-length wild-type Parkin as well as the non-phosphorylatable S65A Parkin mutant. Fourthly, we provide evidence that optimal activation of full-length Parkin E3 ligase is dependent on PINK1-mediated phosphorylation of both Parkin at Ser65 and ubiquitin at Ser65, since only mutation of both proteins at Ser65 completely abolishes Parkin activation. In conclusion, the findings of the present study reveal that PINK1 controls Parkin E3 ligase activity not only by phosphorylating Parkin at Ser65, but also by phosphorylating ubiquitin at Ser65. We propose that phosphorylation of Parkin at Ser65 serves to prime the E3 ligase enzyme for activation by ubiquitinPhospho−Ser65, suggesting that small molecules that mimic ubiquitinPhospho−Ser65 could hold promise as novel therapies for Parkinson's disease.",Pt 1,460,127-139

While chronologically old mitochondria support oxidative respiration, the electron transport chain of new organelles is proteomically immature and they respire less. After cell division, selectively segregated mitochondrial age-classes elicit a metabolic bias in progeny cells, with oxidative energy metabolism promoting differentiation in cells that inherit old mitochondria. Cells that inherit newly synthesized mitochondria with low levels of Rieske iron–sulfur polypeptide 1 have a higher pentose phosphate pathway activity, which promotes de novo purine biosynthesis and redox balance, and is required to maintain stemness during early fate determination after division.

Mitochondrial proteins originate from two genomes: mitochondrial and nuclear. Hence, proper mitochondrial function requires synchronization of gene expression in the nucleus and in mitochondria and necessitates efficient import of mitochondrial proteins into the organelle from the cytosol. Furthermore, the mitochondrial proteome displays high plasticity to allow the adaptation of mitochondrial function to cellular requirements. Maintenance of this complex and adaptable mitochondrial proteome is challenging, but is of crucial importance to cell function. Defects in mitochondrial proteostasis lead to proteotoxic insults and eventually cell death. Different quality control systems monitor the mitochondrial proteome. The cytosolic ubiquitin–proteasome system controls protein transport across the mitochondrial outer membrane and removes damaged or mislocalized proteins. Concomitantly, a number of mitochondrial chaperones and proteases govern protein folding and degrade damaged proteins inside mitochondria. The quality control factors also regulate processing and turnover of native proteins to control protein import, mitochondrial metabolism, signalling cascades, mitochondrial dynamics and lipid biogenesis, further ensuring proper function of mitochondria. Thus, mitochondrial protein quality control mechanisms are of pivotal importance to integrate mitochondria into the cellular environment. The mitochondrial proteome comprises ~1,000–1,500 nuclear-encoded and mitochondrial-encoded proteins. To ensure proper mitochondrial function, cells use multiple mechanisms of quality control that survey mitochondrial protein biogenesis, import and folding, and allow mitochondria to adapt to the changing needs as well as to respond to stresses that compromise proteostasis.",1,22,54-70

Three-dimensional (3D) retinal organoid culture is a cutting-edge technology for differentiating embryonic stem cells into retinal cells by forming a laminated retinal structure. However, 3D culture systems have strict requirements with respect to the experimental environment and culture technologies. Our study aimed to investigate the effect of retinal conditioned medium (RCM) at different developmental stages on the early differentiation of embryonic stem cells into retina in a 3D culture system. Here, we added RCM to the 3D culture system and found it could promote the differentiation of mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) into neuroretina. We further explored the possible mechanisms of RCM that regulate differentiation through proteomic analysis. RCM at different time points disclosed different protein profiles. Proteins which improved energy metabolism of mESCs might help improve the viability of embryonic bodies (EBs). We then screened out Snap25, Cntn1, Negr1, Dpysl2, Dpysl3, and Crmp1 as candidate proteins that might play roles in the differentiation and neurogenesis processes of mESCs, hoping to provide a basis for optimizing a retinal differentiation protocol from embryonic stem cells.",ja,0

When cells were forced to use oxidative phosphorylation rather than glycolysis, they became proteasome-inhibitor resistant. This mitochondrial state, however, creates a unique vulnerability: sensitivity to the small molecule compound elesclomol. Genome-wide CRISPR–Cas9 screening showed that a single gene, encoding the mitochondrial reductase FDX1, could rescue elesclomol-induced cell death. Enzymatic function and nuclear-magnetic-resonance-based analyses further showed that FDX1 is the direct target of elesclomol, which promotes a unique form of copper-dependent cell death. These studies explain a fundamental mechanism by which cells adapt to proteotoxic stress and suggest strategies to mitigate proteasome inhibitor resistance.

Here, we show that elevated FAO activates STAT3 by acetylation via elevated acetyl-coenzyme A (CoA). Acetylated STAT3 upregulates expression of long-chain acyl-CoA synthetase 4 (ACSL4), resulting in increased phospholipid synthesis. Elevating phospholipids in mitochondrial membranes leads to heightened mitochondrial integrity, which in turn overcomes chemotherapy-induced tumor cell apoptosis. Conversely, in both cultured tumor cells and xenograft tumors, enhanced cancer cell apoptosis by inhibiting ASCL4 or specifically targeting acetylated-STAT3 is associated with a reduction in phospholipids within mitochondrial membranes.

Therefore, targeting mitochondria for cancer therapy and overcoming drug resistance has attracted increasing attention for various types of cancer. Multiple mitochondrial adaptation processes, including mitochondrial dynamics, mitochondrial metabolism, and mitochondrial apoptotic regulatory machinery, have been demonstrated to be potential targets. However, recent increasing insights into mitochondria have revealed the complexity of mitochondrial structure and functions, the elusive functions of mitochondria in tumor biology, and the targeting inaccessibility of mitochondria, which have posed challenges for the clinical application of mitochondrial-based cancer therapeutic strategies.

Results from our studies reveal that combined treatment of the ferroptotic agent erastin and the apoptotic agent TRAIL effectively disrupted mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm) and subsequently promoted caspase activation. The alterations of mitochondrial membrane potential are probably due to an increase in oligomerization of BAX and its accumulation at the mitochondria during treatment with erastin and TRAIL.

Lipid peroxidation is a hallmark of ferroptosis and directly destroys cellular membranes, thereby causing ferroptosis. Since lipid peroxidation, which induces ferroptosis, occurs in polyunsaturated fatty acid on specific phospholipids, various lipid metabolic pathways are involved in lipid peroxidation and ferroptosis. Besides, various metabolic and signaling pathways directly and indirectly regulate lipid peroxidation and ferroptosis. Since ferroptosis is associated with a variety of human diseases such as cancer, myocardial infarction, atherosclerosis, kidney diseases, liver diseases, and neuronal diseases, a better understanding of the regulatory mechanisms of ferroptosis can provide insights and treatment strategies for related diseases. Ferroptosis is a type of iron-dependent regulated necrosis induced by lipid peroxidation that occurs in cellular membranes. Among the various lipids, polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) associated with several phospholipids, such as phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) and phosphatidylcholine (PC), are responsible for ferroptosis-inducing lipid peroxidation. Since the de novo synthesis of PUFAs is strongly restricted in mammals, cells take up essential fatty acids from the blood and lymph to produce a variety of PUFAs via PUFA biosynthesis pathways. Free PUFAs can be incorporated into the cellular membrane by several enzymes, such as ACLS4 and LPCAT3, and undergo lipid peroxidation through enzymatic and non-enzymatic mechanisms. These pathways are tightly regulated by various metabolic and signaling pathways. In this review, we summarize our current knowledge of how various lipid metabolic pathways are associated with lipid peroxidation and ferroptosis.

Reintroduction of wild-type PTPMT1, but not catalytically deficient PTPMT1 or truncated PTPMT1 lacking mitochondrial localization, restored differentiation capabilities of PTPMT1 knockout HSCs. Further analyses demonstrated that PTPMT1 deficiency altered mitochondrial metabolism and that phosphatidylinositol phosphate substrates of PTPMT1 directly enhanced fatty-acid-induced activation of mitochondrial uncoupling protein 2. Intriguingly, depletion of PTPMT1 from myeloid, T lymphoid, or B lymphoid progenitors did not cause any defects in lineage-specific knockout mice. This study establishes a crucial role of PTPMT1 in the metabolic regulation of HSC function.",1,12,62-74

Here, we developed a platform of micron-scale cardiac muscle bundles to control biomechanics in arrays of thousands of purified, independently contracting cardiac muscle strips on two-dimensional elastomer substrates with far greater throughput than single cell methods. By defining geometry and workload in this reductionist platform, we show that myofibrillar alignment and auxotonic contractions at physiologic workload drive maturation of contractile function, calcium handling, and electrophysiology. Using transcriptomics, reporter hPSC-CMs, and quantitative immunofluorescence, these cardiac muscle bundles can be used to parse orthogonal cues in early development, including contractile force, calcium load, and metabolic signals. Additionally, the resultant organized biomechanics facilitates automated extraction of contractile kinetics from brightfield microscopy imaging, increasing the accessibility, reproducibility, and throughput of pharmacologic testing and cardiomyopathy disease modeling. Investigations of human cardiac disease involving human pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes are limited by the disorganized presentation of biomechanical cues resulting in cell immaturity.

FA is caused by a depletion of the mitochondrial protein frataxin (FXN), an iron-sulfur (Fe-S) cluster biogenesis factor. To better understand the cellular consequences of FA, we performed quantitative proteome profiling of human cells depleted for FXN. Nearly every known Fe-S cluster-containing protein was depleted in the absence of FXN, indicating that as a rule, cluster binding confers stability to Fe-S proteins. Proteomic and genetic interaction mapping identified impaired mitochondrial translation downstream of FXN loss, and specifically highlighted the methyltransferase-like protein METTL17 as a candidate effector. Using comparative sequence analysis, mutagenesis, biochemistry and cryogenic electron microscopy we show that METTL17 binds to the mitoribosomal small subunit during late assembly and harbors a previously unrecognized [Fe 4 S 4 ] 2+ cluster required for its stability on the mitoribosome. Notably, METTL17 overexpression rescued the mitochondrial translation and bioenergetic defects, but not the cellular growth, of FXN null cells. Our data suggest that METTL17 serves as an Fe-S cluster checkpoint: promoting the translation and assembly of Fe-S cluster rich OXPHOS proteins only when Fe-S cluster levels are replete."

We tested whether spontaneously appearing micronuclei in cancer cells are linked to sub-lethal apoptotic signals. Inhibition of mitochondrial apoptosis or of CAD reduced the number of micronuclei in tumor cell lines as well as the number of chromosomal misalignments in tumor cells and intestinal organoids. Blockade of mitochondrial apoptosis or deletion of CAD reduced, while experimental activation CAD, STING-dependently, enhanced aggressive growth of tumor cells in vitro. Deletion of CAD from human cancer cells reduced metastasis in xenograft models. CAD-deficient cells displayed a substantially altered gene-expression profile, and a CAD-associated gene expression ‘signature’ strongly predicted survival in cancer patients.

Numerous studies further demonstrate that cell type‐specific differences exist in mitochondria, with cells of a given lineage tailoring their endogenous mitochondrial population to suit specific functional needs. These findings, coupled with studies of the therapeutic potential of mitochondrial transplantation, provide a strong impetus to better understand how mitochondria can influence cell function or fate. Here an inducible mitochondrial depletion modelis used to study how cells lacking endogenous mitochondria respond, on a global protein expression level, to transplantation with lineage‐mismatched (LM) mitochondria. It is shown that LM mitochondrial transplantation does not alter the proteomic profile in nonmitochondria–depleted recipient cells; however, enforced depletion of endogenous mitochondria results in dramatic changes in the proteomic landscape, which returns to the predepletion state following internalization of LM mitochondria. These data, derived from a cell system that can be rendered free of influence by endogenous mitochondria, indicate that transplantation of mitochondria—even from a source that differs significantly from the recipient cell population, effectively restores a normal proteomic landscape to cells lacking their own mitochondria. Using a novel doxycycline (DOX) inducible yellow fluorescent protein‐Parkin expression plasmid, cells undergo enforced mitophagy leading to complete mitochondrial depletion. Subsequently, Parkin levels return to normal. This model allows us to perform lineage mismatched complete mitochondrial transplants on depleted cells.

As excess ROS production and oxidative damage are associated with cardiac pathology, it is not surprising that much of the research focused on the deleterious aspects of free radicals. However, cardiomyocytes are naturally highly adapted against repeating oxidative insults, with evidence suggesting that moderate and acute ROS exposure has beneficial consequences for mitochondrial maintenance and cardiac health. Antioxidant defenses, mitochondrial quality control, mtDNA maintenance mechanisms as well as mitochondrial fusion and fission improve mitochondrial function and cardiomyocyte survival under stress conditions.

Human pluripotent stem cells have proven cardiomyocyte-generating abilities and have been extensively investigated for repair of the injured heart. There is still a long way to go before cardiac regenerative medicine can become a reality, however. In this study Charles Murry and colleagues examine the ability of exogenously delivered human embryonic-stem-cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hESC-CMs) to engraft to the host myocardium in a non-human primate model of myocardial infarction. They demonstrate large-scale heart remuscularization, electromechanical coupling of the graft to the host heart, and vascularization of the graft from host vessels. The grafts showed evidence of electromechanical coupling, but non-fatal arrhythmias were also observed in hESC-CM-engrafted primates. Pluripotent stem cells provide a potential solution to current epidemic rates of heart failure1 by providing human cardiomyocytes to support heart regeneration2. Studies of human embryonic-stem-cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hESC-CMs) in small-animal models have shown favourable effects of this treatment3,4,5,6,7. However, it remains unknown whether clinical-scale hESC-CM transplantation is feasible, safe or can provide sufficient myocardial regeneration. Here we show that hESC-CMs can be produced at a clinical scale (more than one billion cells per batch) and cryopreserved with good viability. Using a non-human primate model of myocardial ischaemia followed by reperfusion, we show that cryopreservation and intra-myocardial delivery of one billion hESC-CMs generates extensive remuscularization of the infarcted heart. The hESC-CMs showed progressive but incomplete maturation over a 3-month period. Grafts were perfused by host vasculature, and electromechanical junctions between graft and host myocytes were present within 2 weeks of engraftment. Importantly, grafts showed regular calcium transients that were synchronized to the host electrocardiogram, indicating electromechanical coupling. In contrast to small-animal models7, non-fatal ventricular arrhythmias were observed in hESC-CM-engrafted primates. Thus, hESC-CMs can remuscularize substantial amounts of the infarcted monkey heart. Comparable remuscularization of a human heart should be possible, but potential arrhythmic complications need to be overcome.",7504,510,273-277

Here we show that transplantation of ∼750 million cryopreserved human embryonic stem cell–derived cardiomyocytes (hESC-CMs) enhances cardiac function in macaque monkeys with large myocardial infarctions. One month after hESC-CM transplantation, global left ventricular ejection fraction improved 10.6 ± 0.9% vs. 2.5 ± 0.8% in controls, and by 3 months there was an additional 12.4% improvement in treated vs. a 3.5% decline in controls.

Perturbations in ATP-generating processes may therefore affect contractile function directly. Characterizing cardiac metabolism in heart failure (HF) revealed several metabolic alterations called metabolic remodeling, ranging from changes in substrate use to mitochondrial dysfunction, ultimately resulting in ATP deficiency and impaired contractility. However, ATP depletion is not the only relevant consequence of metabolic remodeling during HF. By providing cellular building blocks and signaling molecules, metabolic pathways control essential processes such as cell growth and regeneration. Thus, alterations in cardiac metabolism may also affect the progression to HF by mechanisms beyond ATP supply. Our aim is therefore to highlight that metabolic remodeling in HF not only results in impaired cardiac energetics but also induces other processes implicated in the development of HF such as structural remodeling and oxidative stress. Accordingly, modulating cardiac metabolism in HF may have significant therapeutic relevance that goes beyond the energetic aspect.",6,113,709-724

A complex system comprised of regulatory factors and energy metabolic machinery, encoded by both mitochondrial and nuclear genomes, is required for the coordinate control of cardiac mitochondrial biogenesis, maturation, and high-capacity function. This process involves the action of a transcriptional regulatory network that builds and maintains the mitochondrial genome and drives the expression of the energy transduction machinery. This finely tuned system is responsive to developmental and physiological cues, as well as changes in fuel substrate availability. Deficiency of components critical for mitochondrial energy production frequently manifests as a cardiomyopathic phenotype, underscoring the requirement to maintain high respiration rates in the heart. Although a precise causative role is not clear, there is increasing evidence that perturbations in this regulatory system occur in the hypertrophied and failing heart.

Lopaschuk,Qutuba G. Karwi,Rong Tian,Adam R. Wende,E. Dale Abel",Circulation Research,,,Circ Res,0009-7330,"Alterations in cardiac energy metabolism contribute to the severity of heart failure. However, the energy metabolic changes that occur in heart failure are complex and are dependent not only on the severity and type of heart failure present but also on the co-existence of common comorbidities such as obesity and type 2 diabetes. The failing heart faces an energy deficit, primarily because of a decrease in mitochondrial oxidative capacity. This is partly compensated for by an increase in ATP production from glycolysis. The relative contribution of the different fuels for mitochondrial ATP production also changes, including a decrease in glucose and amino acid oxidation, and an increase in ketone oxidation. The oxidation of fatty acids by the heart increases or decreases, depending on the type of heart failure. For instance, in heart failure associated with diabetes and obesity, myocardial fatty acid oxidation increases, while in heart failure associated with hypertension or ischemia, myocardial fatty acid oxidation decreases. Combined, these energy metabolic changes result in the failing heart becoming less efficient (ie, a decrease in cardiac work/O2 consumed). The alterations in both glycolysis and mitochondrial oxidative metabolism in the failing heart are due to both transcriptional changes in key enzymes involved in these metabolic pathways, as well as alterations in NAD redox state (NAD+ and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide levels) and metabolite signaling that contribute to posttranslational epigenetic changes in the control of expression of genes encoding energy metabolic enzymes. Alterations in the fate of glucose, beyond flux through glycolysis or glucose oxidation, also contribute to the pathology of heart failure. Of importance, pharmacological targeting of the energy metabolic pathways has emerged as a novel therapeutic approach to improving cardiac efficiency, decreasing the energy deficit and improving cardiac function in the failing heart.",10,128,1487-1513

The subsequent evolution of aerobic metabolism in prokaryotes to form aerobic bacteria (protoflagella and protomitochondria) presumably occurred during the transition to the oxidizing atmosphere. Classical mitosis evolved in protozoan-type cells millions of years after the evolution of photosynthesis. A plausible scheme for the origin of classical mitosis in primitive amoeboflagellates is presented. During the course of the evolution of mitosis, photosynthetic plastids (themselves derived from prokaryotes) were symbiotically acquired by some of these protozoans to form the eukaryotic algae and the green plants.The cytological, biochemical and paleontological evidence for this theory is presented, along with suggestions for further possible experimental verification.

In the nuclear subtree, plants branch off late, at a position reflecting a massive radiation of the major multicellular (and some unicellular) groups; in the mitochondrial subtree, in contrast, plants branch off early, near the point of connection between the mitochondrial and eubacterial lineages. Moreover, in the nuclear lineage, plants branch together with the unicellular green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, whereas in the mitochondrial lineage (in both SSU and LSU trees), metaphytes and chlorophyte branch separately. Statistical evaluation indicates that the anomalous branching position of higher plants in the mitochondrial lineage is not a treeing artifact attributable to the relatively rapid rate of sequence divergence of non-plant mitochondrial rRNA sequences. In considering alternative biological explanations for these results, we are led to propose that the rRNA genes in plant mitochondria may be of more recent evolutionary origin than the rRNA genes in other mitochondria. This proposal has implications for monophyletic vs. polyphyletic scenarios of mitochondrial origin and is consistent with other evidence indicating that plant mtDNA is an evolutionary mosaic.",7,86,2267-2271

Although these morphologic changes are considered crucial for cellular functions, the underlying mechanisms remain elusive, especially in mammalian cells. We characterized two rat mitochondrial outer membrane proteins, Mfn1 and Mfn2, with distinct tissue expressions, that are homologous to Drosophila Fzo, a GTPase involved in mitochondrial fusion. Expression of the GTPase-domain mutant of Mfn2 (Mfn2(K109T)) in HeLa cells induced mitochondrial fragmentation in which Mfn2(K109T) localized at the restricted domains. Immuno-electronmicroscopy revealed that Mfn2(K109T) was concentrated at the contact domains between adjacent mitochondria, suggesting that fusion of the outer membrane was arrested at some intermediate step. Mfn1 expression induced highly connected tubular network structures depending on the functional GTPase domain. The Mfn1-induced tubular networks were suppressed by co-expression with Mfn2. In vivo depletion of either isoform by RNA interference revealed that both are required to maintain normal mitochondrial morphology. The fusion of differentially-labeled mitochondria in HeLa cells subjected to depletion of either Mfn isoform and subsequent cell fusion by hemagglutinating virus of Japan revealed that both proteins have distinct functions in mitochondrial fusion.

Upon induction of apoptosis, Drp1 translocates from the cytosol to mitochondria, where it preferentially localizes to potential sites of organelle division. Inhibition of Drp1 by overexpression of a dominant-negative mutant counteracts the conversion to a punctiform mitochondrial phenotype, prevents the loss of the mitochondrial membrane potential and the release of cytochrome c, and reveals a reproducible swelling of the organelles.

They are double-membraned and produce ATP and hydrogen, hence suggestions that they are anaerobic derivatives of mitochondria. An alternative view suggests that mitochondria and hydrogenosomes arose from a common ancestor, a facultatively anaerobic bacterium. The discovery of a novel hydrogenosome in Nyctotherus ovalis, a ciliate that lives in the gut of cockroaches, further complicates this debate. It is unique among known hydrogenosomes because, just like a mitochondrion, it retains its own genome. This ‘missing link’ between hydrogenosomes and mitochondria also has remnants of an electron transport chain characteristic of an aerobic lifestyle. Hydrogenosomes are organelles that produce ATP and hydrogen1, and are found in various unrelated eukaryotes, such as anaerobic flagellates, chytridiomycete fungi and ciliates2. Although all of these organelles generate hydrogen, the hydrogenosomes from these organisms are structurally and metabolically quite different, just like mitochondria where large differences also exist3. These differences have led to a continuing debate about the evolutionary origin of hydrogenosomes4,5. Here we show that the hydrogenosomes of the anaerobic ciliate Nyctotherus ovalis, which thrives in the hindgut of cockroaches, have retained a rudimentary genome encoding components of a mitochondrial electron transport chain. Phylogenetic analyses reveal that those proteins cluster with their homologues from aerobic ciliates. In addition, several nucleus-encoded components of the mitochondrial proteome, such as pyruvate dehydrogenase and complex II, were identified. The N. ovalis hydrogenosome is sensitive to inhibitors of mitochondrial complex I and produces succinate as a major metabolic end product—biochemical traits typical of anaerobic mitochondria3. The production of hydrogen, together with the presence of a genome encoding respiratory chain components, and biochemical features characteristic of anaerobic mitochondria, identify the N. ovalis organelle as a missing link between mitochondria and hydrogenosomes.",7029,434,74-79

The electron flow is coupled with the generation of a proton gradient across the inner membrane and the energy accumulated in the proton gradient is used by complex V (ATP synthase) to produce ATP. The first part of this review briefly introduces the structure and function of complexes I-IV and ATP synthase, including the specific electron transfer process in each complex. Some electrons are directly transferred to O2 to generate reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the ETC. The second part of this review discusses the sites of ROS generation in each ETC complex, including sites IF and IQ in complex I, site IIF in complex II and site IIIQo in complex III, and the physiological and pathological regulation of ROS.

The occurrence and development of a number of diseases are closely related to ROS overproduction. Finally, proton leak and uncoupling proteins (UCPS) are discussed. Proton leak consists of basal proton leak and induced proton leak. Induced proton leak is precisely regulated and induced by UCPs. A total of five UCPs (UCP1-5) have been identified in mammalian cells. UCP1 mainly plays a role in the maintenance of body temperature in a cold environment through non-shivering thermogenesis. The core role of UCP2-5 is to reduce oxidative stress under certain conditions, therefore exerting cytoprotective effects.

Wilson,The Journal of Physiology,,,J Physiology,0022-3751,"Oxidative phosphorylation provides most of the ATP that higher animals and plants use to support life and is responsible for setting and maintaining metabolic homeostasis. The pathway incorporates three consecutive near equilibrium steps for moving reducing equivalents between the intramitochondrial [NAD+]/[NADH] pool to molecular oxygen, with irreversible reduction of oxygen to bound peroxide at cytochrome c oxidase determining the net flux. Net flux (oxygen consumption rate) is determined by demand for ATP, with feedback by the energy state ([ATP]/[ADP][Pi]) regulating the pathway. This feedback affects the reversible steps equally and independently, resulting in the rate being coupled to ([ATP]/[ADP][Pi])3. With increasing energy state, oxygen consumption decreases rapidly until a threshold is reached, above which there is little further decrease. In most cells, [ATP] and [Pi] are much higher than [ADP] and change in [ADP] is primarily responsible for the change in energy state. As a result, the rate of ATP synthesis, plotted against [ADP], remains low until [ADP] reaches about 30 μm and then increases rapidly with further increase in [ADP]. The dependencies on energy state and [ADP] near the threshold can be fitted by the Hill equation with a Hill coefficients of about −2.6 and 4.2, respectively. The homeostatic set point for metabolism is determined by the threshold, which can be modulated by the and intramitochondrial [NAD+]/[NADH]. The ability of oxidative phosphorylation to precisely set and maintain metabolic homeostasis is consistent with it being permissive of, and essential to, development of higher plants and animals. Integration of oxidative phosphorylation into cellular metabolism made possible the evolutionary development of higher organisms. Progressive improvements in control of oxidative phosphorylation supported the increasing demands of specialized tissues, in particular muscles and neurons. One of these improvements, replacing arginine kinase with creatine kinase, was permissive of the evolutionary development of vertebrates.",23,595,7023-7038

Sinclair",Nature Reviews Endocrinology,,,Nat Rev Endocrinol,1759-5029,"Organismal ageing is accompanied by progressive loss of cellular function and systemic deterioration of multiple tissues, leading to impaired function and increased vulnerability to death. Mitochondria have become recognized not merely as being energy suppliers but also as having an essential role in the development of diseases associated with ageing, such as neurodegenerative and cardiovascular diseases. A growing body of evidence suggests that ageing and age-related diseases are tightly related to an energy supply and demand imbalance, which might be alleviated by a variety of interventions, including physical activity and calorie restriction, as well as naturally occurring molecules targeting conserved longevity pathways. Here, we review key historical advances and progress from the past few years in our understanding of the role of mitochondria in ageing and age-related metabolic diseases. We also highlight emerging scientific innovations using mitochondria-targeted therapeutic approaches. This Review discusses the role of mitochondria in metabolism and how mitochondria contribute to age-related metabolic diseases. This knowledge might guide us in designing therapies targeting metabolic disorders to extend human health span and lifespan. The rate of ageing is coordinated, at least in part, by conserved genetic and biochemical pathways.A complex network of interactions between longevity pathways reveals an intricate regulation of mitochondrial physiology during ageing.Cellular metabolism interconnects the nine hallmarks of ageing, and deregulation of energy metabolism by environmental variations is an essential process leading to mitochondrial dysfunction during ageing.A better understanding of mitochondrial dysfunction during ageing and age-related metabolic diseases will provide fundamental knowledge to develop therapies to combat late-life morbidities.Human longitudinal studies will be essential to understand individuals’ risk of diseases much earlier in life, and will inform health choices and medical care options.

Several underlying mechanisms of deregulated cellular energetics are associated with mitochondrial dysfunction caused by mitochondrial DNA mutations, mitochondrial enzyme defects, or altered oncogenes/tumor suppressors. In this review, we summarize the current understanding about the role of mitochondrial dysfunction in cancer progression. Point mutations and copy number changes are the two most common mitochondrial DNA alterations in cancers, and mitochondrial dysfunction induced by chemical depletion of mitochondrial DNA or impairment of mitochondrial respiratory chain in cancer cells promotes cancer progression to a chemoresistance or invasive phenotype. Moreover, defects in mitochondrial enzymes, such as succinate dehydrogenase, fumarate hydratase, and isocitrate dehydrogenase, are associated with both familial and sporadic forms of cancer. Deregulated mitochondrial deacetylase sirtuin 3 might modulate cancer progression by regulating cellular metabolism and oxidative stress. These mitochondrial defects during oncogenesis and tumor progression activate cytosolic signaling pathways that ultimately alter nuclear gene expression, a process called retrograde signaling. Changes in the intracellular level of reactive oxygen species, Ca2+, or oncometabolites are important in the mitochondrial retrograde signaling for neoplastic transformation and cancer progression. In addition, altered oncogenes/tumor suppressors including hypoxia-inducible factor 1 and tumor suppressor p53 regulate mitochondrial respiration and cellular metabolism by modulating the expression of their target genes. We thus suggest that mitochondrial dysfunction plays a critical role in cancer progression and that targeting mitochondrial alterations and mitochondrial retrograde signaling might be a promising strategy for the development of selective anticancer therapy.",12,241,1281-1295

Loss of mitochondrial function can drive age-related declines in the function of many post-mitotic tissues, but little is known about how mitochondrial dysfunction affects mitotic tissues. We show here that several manipulations that compromise mitochondrial function in proliferating human cells induce a senescence growth arrest with a modified SASP that lacks the IL-1-dependent inflammatory arm. Cells that underwent mitochondrial dysfunction-associated senescence (MiDAS) had lower NAD+/NADH ratios, which caused both the growth arrest and prevented the IL-1-associated SASP through AMPK-mediated p53 activation. Progeroid mice that rapidly accrue mtDNA mutations accumulated senescent cells with a MiDAS SASP in vivo, which suppressed adipogenesis and stimulated keratinocyte differentiation in cell culture.

Zahedi,Nikolaus Pfanner,Chris Meisinger,Albert Sickmann",Journal of Proteome Research,,,J Proteome Res,1535-3893,"Proteomic analyses of different subcellular compartments, so-called organellar proteomics, facilitate the understanding of cellular functions on a molecular level. In this work, various orthogonal multidimensional separation techniques both on the protein and on the peptide level are compared with regard to the number of identified proteins as well as the classes of proteins accessible by the respective methodology. The most complete overview was achieved by a combination of such orthogonal techniques as shown by the analysis of the yeast mitochondrial proteome. A total of 851 different proteins (PROMITO dataset) were identified by use of multidimensional LC−MS/MS, 1D-SDS-PAGE combined with nano-LC−MS/MS and 2D-PAGE with subsequent MALDI-mass fingerprinting. Our PROMITO approach identified the 749 proteins, which were found in the largest previous study on the yeast mitochondrial proteome, and additionally 102 proteins including 42 open reading frames with unknown function, providing the basis for a more detailed elucidation of mitochondrial processes. Comparison of the different approaches emphasizes a bias of 2D-PAGE against proteins with very high isoelectric points as well as large and hydrophobic proteins, which can be accessed more appropriately by the other methods. While 2D-PAGE has advantages in the possible separation of protein isoforms and quantitative differential profiling, 1D-SDS-PAGE with nano-LC−MS/MS and multidimensional LC−MS/MS are better suited for efficient protein identification as they are less biased against distinct classes of proteins. Thus, comprehensive proteome analyses can only be realized by a combination of such orthogonal approaches, leading to the largest dataset available for the mitochondrial proteome of yeast.

Across tissues, expression covariation between genes' proteins and transcripts—measured in the same individuals—broadly aligned. Covariation was however far stronger in certain subsets than others: only 8% of transcripts in the lowest expression and variance quintile covaried with their protein, in contrast to 65% of transcripts in the highest quintiles. Key functional differences among the 3648 genes were also observed across tissues, with electron transport chain (ETC) genes particularly investigated. ETC complex proteins covary and form strong gene networks according to tissue, but their equivalent transcripts do not. Certain physiological consequences, such as the depletion of ATP synthase in BAT, are thus obscured in transcript data. Lastly, we compared the quantitative proteomic measurements between the total cell and mitochondrial fractions for the five tissues.

The mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) is a protein kinase that senses growth signals to regulate anabolic growth and proliferation. Activation of mTORC1 led to the acute stimulation of metabolic flux through the de novo pyrimidine synthesis pathway. mTORC1 signaling posttranslationally regulated this metabolic pathway via its downstream target ribosomal protein S6 kinase 1 (S6K1), which directly phosphorylates S1859 on CAD (carbamoyl-phosphate synthetase 2, aspartate transcarbamoylase, dihydroorotase), the enzyme that catalyzes the first three steps of de novo pyrimidine synthesis.

Motta,Stefania A. Nottola,Sayoko Makabe,Rosemarie Heyn",Human Reproduction,,,Hum Reprod,0268-1161,"The aim of this study has been to observe, by electron microscopy, the morphological changes affecting mitochondria and associated organelles in the human female germ cell during oogenesis, maturation and fertilization. In the primordial germ cell (PGC), rounded mitochondria with a pale matrix and small vesicular cristae are disposed near the nucleus and significantly increase in number during PGC migration and settlement in the gonadal ridge, where they differentiate into oogonia. In these early stages of mammalian oogenesis, aggregates of mitochondria are typically clustered around or in close relationship with the nuage. In oocytes at early prophase stage, mitochondria proliferate while aligned along the outer surface of the nuclear membrane, contain a more dense matrix than before, and have lamellar cristae. Oocytes of primordial and primary follicles mostly contain round or irregular mitochondria whose matrix has become very light. These mitochondria show typical parallel, arched cristae, and are clustered near the nucleus with other organelles forming the Balbiani's vitelline body. When follicles grow, the mitochondria of the oocytes become even more numerous and are dispersed in the ooplasm. Both paranuclear accumulation and subsequent dispersion of mitochondria in the cytoplasm are likely to be regulated by microtubules. By ovulation, mitochondria are the most prominent organelles in the ooplasm. They form voluminous aggregates with smooth endoplasmic reticulum (SER) tubules and vesicles. These mitochondrial–SER aggregates (M–SER) and the mitochondrial–vesicle complexes (MV) could be involved in the production of a reservoir of substances or membranes anticipating subsequent fertilization and early embryogenesis. Just after fertilization, the mitochondria of the oocyte undergo a further substantial change in size, shape, and microtopography. In the pronuclear zygote, mitochondria concentrate around the pronuclei. During the first embryonic cleavage divisions, round or oval mitochondria with a dense matrix and few arched cristae are gradually replaced by elongated ones with a less dense matrix and numerous transverse cristae. A progressive reduction in size and number of M–SER aggregates and MV complexes also occurs. In summary, oocyte mitochondria show dynamic morphological changes as they increase in number and populate different cell domains within the oocyte. They form complex relationships with other cell organelles, according to the different energetic -metabolic needs of the cell during differentiation, maturation, and fertilization, and are ultimately inherited by the developing embryo, where they eventually assume a more typical somatic cell form.",suppl_2,15,129-147

Previous research has suggested that an increase in G6PD activity is important for cell growth. In this article, we suggest that G6PD activity plays a critical role in cell growth by providing NADPH for redox regulation. The results show the following: 1) inhibition of G6PD activity abrogated growth factor stimulation of [3H]thymidine incorporation in all cell lines tested; 2) overexpression of G6PD stimulated cell growth, as measured by an increase in [3H]thymidine incorporations as compared with cells transfected with vector alone; 3) inhibition of G6PD caused cells to be more susceptible to the growth inhibitory effects of H2O2; 4) inhibition of G6PD led to a 30–40% decrease in the NADPH/NADP ratio; and 5) inhibition of G6PD inhibited cell anchorage and significantly decreased the growth-related stimulation of tyrosine phosphorylation.",17,273,10609-10617

Using MS-based metabolomics, we show that embryonic stem cells are characterized by abundant metabolites with highly unsaturated structures whose levels decrease upon differentiation. By monitoring the reduced and oxidized glutathione ratio as well as ascorbic acid levels, we demonstrate that the stem cell redox status is regulated during differentiation. On the basis of the oxidative biochemistry of the unsaturated metabolites, we experimentally manipulated specific pathways in embryonic stem cells while monitoring the effects on differentiation. Inhibition of the eicosanoid signaling pathway promoted pluripotency and maintained levels of unsaturated fatty acids. In contrast, downstream oxidized metabolites (for example, neuroprotectin D1) and substrates of pro-oxidative reactions (for example, acyl-carnitines), promoted neuronal and cardiac differentiation.

Ablation of TFAM in keratinocytes impaired epidermal differentiation and hair follicle growth and resulted in death 2 weeks after birth. TFAM-deficient keratinocytes failed to generate mitochondria-derived ROS, a deficiency that prevented the transmission of Notch and β-catenin signals essential for epidermal differentiation and hair follicle development, respectively.

A role for mitochondria in hPSC bioenergetics and in cell differentiation therefore remains uncertain. Here, we show that hPSCs have functional respiratory complexes that are able to consume O2 at maximal capacity. Despite this, ATP generation in hPSCs is mainly by glycolysis and ATP is consumed by the F1F0 ATP synthase to partially maintain hPSC mitochondrial membrane potential and cell viability. Uncoupling protein 2 (UCP2) plays a regulating role in hPSC energy metabolism by preventing mitochondrial glucose oxidation and facilitating glycolysis via a substrate shunting mechanism. With early differentiation, hPSC proliferation slows, energy metabolism decreases, and UCP2 is repressed, resulting in decreased glycolysis and maintained or increased mitochondrial glucose oxidation. Ectopic UCP2 expression perturbs this metabolic transition and impairs hPSC differentiation. Overall, hPSCs contain active mitochondria and require UCP2 repression for full differentiation potential. While studying metabolic fluxes in human pluripotent stem cells, this paper reveals UCP2 as metabolic switch from glycolysis to OXPHOS, facilitating early differentiation events.",24,30,4860-4873

Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) are a novel stem cell population obtained from somatic cells through forced expression of a set of genes normally expressed in embryonic stem cells (ESCs). These reprogrammed cells acquire self‐renewal properties and appear almost undistinguishable from ESCs in terms of morphology, gene expression, and differentiation potential. Accordingly, iPSCs exhibit alterations of the senescence‐related telomerase and p53 signaling pathways. However, although treatments with antioxidants have been recently shown to enhance cellular reprogramming, detailed information regarding the state of the mitochondrial/oxidative stress pathway in iPSCs is still lacking. Mitochondria undergo specific changes during organismal development and aging. Thus, addressing whether somatic mitochondria within iPSCs acquire ESC‐like features or retain the phenotype of the parental cell is an unanswered but relevant question. Herein, we demonstrate that somatic mitochondria within human iPSCs revert to an immature ESC‐like state with respect to organelle morphology and distribution, expression of nuclear factors involved in mitochondrial biogenesis, content of mitochondrial DNA, intracellular ATP level, oxidative damage, and lactate generation. Upon differentiation, mitochondria within iPSCs and ESCs exhibited analogous maturation and anaerobic‐to‐aerobic metabolic modifications. Overall, the data highlight that human iPSCs and ESCs, although not identical, share similar mitochondrial properties and suggest that cellular reprogramming can modulate the mitochondrial/oxidative stress pathway, thus inducing a rejuvenated state capable of escaping cellular senescence.

The activation of dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1), as well as its mitochondrial translocation, play important roles in the changes of both mitochondrial morphology and mitochondrial functions after hypoxia. However, in addition to mediating mitochondrial fission, whether Drp1 has other regulatory roles in mitochondrial homeostasis after mitochondrial translocation is unknown. In this study, we performed a series of interaction and colocalization assays and found that, after mitochondrial translocation, Drp1 may promote the excessive opening of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP) after hypoxia. Firstly, mitochondrial Drp1 maximumly recognizes mPTP channels by binding Bcl-2-associated X protein (BAX) and a phosphate carrier protein (PiC) in the mPTP. Then, leucine-rich repeat serine/threonine-protein kinase 2 (LRRK2) is recruited, whose kinase activity is inhibited by direct binding with mitochondrial Drp1 after hypoxia. Subsequently, the mPTP-related protein hexokinase 2 (HK2) is inactivated at Thr-473 and dissociates from the mitochondrial membrane, ultimately causing structural disruption and overopening of mPTP, which aggravates mitochondrial and cellular dysfunction after hypoxia. Thus, our study interprets the dual direct regulation of mitochondrial Drp1 on mitochondrial morphology and functions after hypoxia and proposes a new mitochondrial fission-independent mechanism for the role of Drp1 after its translocation in hypoxic injury.",11,12,1050

It is effective against various types of cancers, including carcinomas, germ cell tumors, lymphomas, and sarcomas. Its mode of action has been linked to its ability to crosslink with the purine bases on the DNA; interfering with DNA repair mechanisms, causing DNA damage, and subsequently inducing apoptosis in cancer cells. However, because of drug resistance and numerous undesirable side effects such as severe kidney problems, allergic reactions, decrease immunity to infections, gastrointestinal disorders, hemorrhage, and hearing loss especially in younger patients, other platinum-containing anti-cancer drugs such as carboplatin, oxaliplatin and others, have also been used. Furthermore, combination therapies of cisplatin with other drugs have been highly considered to overcome drug-resistance and reduce toxicity.

Ninety percent of ovarian cancers are epithelial, the most common being serous carcinoma, for which incidence is highest in non‐Hispanic whites (NHWs) (5.2 per 100,000) and lowest in non‐Hispanic blacks (NHBs) and Asians/Pacific Islanders (APIs) (3.4 per 100,000). Notably, however, APIs have the highest incidence of endometrioid and clear cell carcinomas, which occur at younger ages and help explain comparable epithelial cancer incidence for APIs and NHWs younger than 55 years. Most serous carcinomas are diagnosed at stage III (51%) or IV (29%), for which the 5‐year cause‐specific survival for patients diagnosed during 2007 through 2013 was 42% and 26%, respectively. For all stages of epithelial cancer combined, 5‐year survival is highest in APIs (57%) and lowest in NHBs (35%), who have the lowest survival for almost every stage of diagnosis across cancer subtypes. Moreover, survival has plateaued in NHBs for decades despite increasing in NHWs, from 40% for cases diagnosed during 1992 through 1994 to 47% during 2007 through 2013. Progress in reducing ovarian cancer incidence and mortality can be accelerated by reducing racial disparities and furthering knowledge of etiology and tumorigenesis to facilitate strategies for prevention and early detection.

For most gynecologic cancers including ovarian, cervical, and placental, the list of available small molecule therapies is relatively small compared to options for other cancers. While overall cancer mortality rates have decreased in the United States as early diagnoses and cancer therapies have become more effective, ovarian cancer still has low survival rates due to the lack of effective treatment options, drug resistance, and late diagnosis. To understand chemotherapeutic diversity in gynecologic cancers, we have screened 7914 approved drugs and bioactive compounds in 11 gynecologic cancer cell lines to profile their chemotherapeutic sensitivity. We identified two HDAC inhibitors, mocetinostat and entinostat, as pan-gynecologic cancer suppressors with IC50 values within an order of magnitude of their human plasma concentrations. In addition, many active compounds identified, including the non-anticancer drugs and other compounds, diversely inhibited the growth of three gynecologic cancer cell groups and individual cancer cell lines. These newly identified compounds are valuable for further studies of new therapeutics development, synergistic drug combinations, and new target identification for gynecologic cancers. The results also provide a rationale for the personalized chemotherapeutic testing of anticancer drugs in treatment of gynecologic cancer.",3,12,441-452

Kelland,Critical Reviews in Oncology/Hematology,,,Crit Rev Oncol Hemat,1040-8428,"Over the past two decades, platinum-based drugs (cis-platin and, latterly, the less toxic analogue carboplatin) have conferred significant therapeutic benefit to a large number of cancer suffers. However, there remains scope for substantial improvement in the clinical utility of metal coordination complexes through the discovery of additional platinum-based complexes (or possibly alternative metals). Future drug discovery strategies should focus on tumor resistance and its circumvention. To date, only one series of compounds, those containing a 1,2-diaminocyclohexane carrier ligand (e.g., oxaliplatin, tetraplatin), has entered clinical trial based on their circumvention of acquired cisplatin resistance in some (mainly murine) preclinical tumor models. At present these agents are in early clinical trial and thus their true clinical utility in cisplatin/carboplatin refractory disease is not yet determinable (and may not be due to dose-limiting neurotoxicity).Over the past few years, our understanding of mechanisms of resistance to cisplatin and its interaction with DNA has vastly increased. This new information will undoubtedly guide the development of new strategies aimed at the circumvention of intrinsic and acquired tumor resistance to cisplatin. Approaches to circumvent resistance will probably involve not only the rational development of a new generation of platinum-based drugs (e.g., compounds designed to overcome reduced cisplatin accumulation or enhanced removal of cisplatin-induced DNA adducts) but also non-platinum drugs which are capable of modulating resistance (e.g., modulators of signal transduction pathways, ras and myc oncogene expression and glutathione biosynthesis). One may look forward with a great deal of optimism that these promising new approaches will result in clinical benefit by the end of the century. Nevertheless, cis-platin and carboplatin remain the standard anticancer drugs to which novel platinum-based complexes must be compared.",3,15,191-219

Its cytotoxic mode of action is mediated by its interaction with DNA to form DNA adducts, primarily intrastrand crosslink adducts, which activate several signal transduction pathways, including those involving ATR, p53, p73, and MAPK, and culminate in the activation of apoptosis. DNA damage-mediated apoptotic signals, however, can be attenuated, and the resistance that ensues is a major limitation of cisplatin-based chemotherapy. The mechanisms responsible for cisplatin resistance are several, and contribute to the multifactorial nature of the problem. Resistance mechanisms that limit the extent of DNA damage include reduced drug uptake, increased drug inactivation, and increased DNA adduct repair. Origins of these pharmacologic-based mechanisms, however, are at the molecular level. Mechanisms that inhibit propagation of the DNA damage signal to the apoptotic machinery include loss of damage recognition, overexpression of HER-2/neu, activation of the PI3-K/Akt (also known as PI3-K/PKB) pathway, loss of p53 function, overexpression of antiapoptotic bcl-2, and interference in caspase activation. The molecular signature defining the resistant phenotype varies between tumors, and the number of resistance mechanisms activated in response to selection pressures dictates the overall extent of cisplatin resistance.",47,22,7265-7279

Although some platinum-sensitive tumours may be cured by combination chemotherapy (e.g. testicular cancer), most will relapse and subsequently prove resistant to platinum compounds. The mechanisms of platinum resistance in patients are still poorly understood. Clearly, when a tumour relapses a long time after successful first-line treatment, there is a high chance that it will still be sensitive to platinum compounds. A number of studies have attempted to assess the role of drug transport, the glutathione system, DNA repair and apoptosis genes in the development of resistance in tumours, but no conclusive evidence is available. Approaches to increasing the potency of platinum therapy (to overcome resistance) have been devised and some have proved to be effective; in particular, intraperitoneal administration of cisplatin has shown superiority over intravenous administration in selected patients with ovarian cancer. The development of drugs and techniques to reduce the adverse effects of platinum chemotherapy has greatly improved their administration. Investigations attempting to modulate platinum activity and toxicity have also been performed. Further investigation of in vivo resistance mechanisms should be valuable in allowing prediction of clinical response to chemotherapy and may identify new treatments with the potential to improve outcomes for patients with a variety of platinum-resistant tumour types.",Suppl 4,59,9-17

We further show that in extracts from caspase-3-deficient MCF-7 cells, procaspase-9 processing is strongly impaired after stimulation with either cytochrome c or recombinant caspase-8. Reconstitution of MCF-7 cell extracts with procaspase-3 corrects this defect, resulting in an efficient and complete processing of procaspase-9.

Circumventing cisplatin resistance remains, therefore, a major goal for clinical therapy and represents a challenge for scientific research. Recent studies have brought to light the fundamental role of mitochondria in onset, progression, and metastasis of cancer, as well as its importance in the resistance to chemotherapy. The aim of this review is to give an overview of the current knowledge about the implication of mitochondria in cisplatin resistance and on the recent development in this research field. Recent studies have highlighted the role of mitochondrial DNA alterations in onset of resistance phenomena, being related both to redox balance alterations and to signal crosstalk with the nucleus, allowing a rewiring of cell metabolism. Moreover, an important role of the mitochondrial dynamics in the adaptation mechanism of cancer cells to challenging environment has been revealed. Giving bioenergetic plasticity to tumor cells, mitochondria allow cells to evade death pathways in stressful conditions, including chemotherapy.

Among them, caspase-3 is a frequently activated death protease, catalyzing the specific cleavage of many key cellular proteins. However, the specific requirements of this (or any other) caspase in apoptosis have remained largely unknown until now. Pathways to caspase-3 activation have been identified that are either dependent on or independent of mitochondrial cytochrome c release and caspase-9 function. Caspase-3 is essential for normal brain development and is important or essential in other apoptotic scenarios in a remarkable tissue-, cell type- or death stimulus-specific manner. Caspase-3 is also required for some typical hallmarks of apoptosis, and is indispensable for apoptotic chromatin condensation and DNA fragmentation in all cell types examined. Thus, caspase-3 is essential for certain processes associated with the dismantling of the cell and the formation of apoptotic bodies, but it may also function before or at the stage when commitment to loss of cell viability is made.",2,6,99-104

Olayioye,Walter E. Aulitzky,Frank Essmann",Cell Death & Disease,,,Cell Death Dis,,"Patients with high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSC) frequently receive platinum-based chemotherapeutics, such as cisplatin. Cisplatin binds to DNA and induces DNA-damage culminating in mitochondria-mediated apoptosis. Interestingly, mitochondrial DNA is critically affected by cisplatin but its relevance in cell death induction is scarcely investigated. We find that cisplatin sensitive HGSC cell lines contain higher mitochondrial content and higher levels of mitochondrial ROS (mtROS) than cells resistant to cisplatin induced cell death. In clonal sub-lines from OVCAR-3 mitochondrial content and basal oxygen consumption rate correlate with sensitivity to cisplatin induced apoptosis. Mitochondria are in two ways pivotal for cisplatin sensitivity because not only knock-down of BAX and BAK but also the ROS scavenger glutathione diminish cisplatin induced apoptosis. Mitochondrial ROS correlates with mitochondrial content and reduction of mitochondrial biogenesis by knock-down of transcription factors PGC1α or TFAM attenuates both mtROS induction and cisplatin induced apoptosis. Increasing mitochondrial ROS by inhibition or knock-down of the ROS-protective uncoupling protein UCP2 enhances cisplatin induced apoptosis. Similarly, enhancing ROS by high-dose ascorbic acid or H2O2 augments cisplatin induced apoptosis. In summary, mitochondrial content and the resulting mitochondrial capacity to produce ROS critically determine HGSC cell sensitivity to cisplatin induced apoptosis. In line with this observation, data from the human protein atlas (www.proteinatlas.org) indicates that high expression of mitochondrial marker proteins (TFAM and TIMM23) is a favorable prognostic factor in ovarian cancer patients. Thus, we propose mitochondrial content as a biomarker for the response to platinum-based therapies. Functionally, this might be exploited by increasing mitochondrial content or mitochondrial ROS production to enhance sensitivity to cisplatin based anti-cancer therapies.",11,10,851

It is well documented that cisplatin (CDDP) treatment increases the expression of adenosine A1 receptors in both kidney and testes. However, the effect of adenosine at these receptors is controversial. Adenosine A1 receptors have been documented to be involved in either cytoprotection or aggravation of nephrotoxicity. The aim of the present study was to examine the effect of the non‐selective adenosine receptor inhibitor theophylline and the phosphodiesterase inhibitor pentoxifylline on CDDP‐induced renal and testicular toxicity. 2. Male Wister rats were divided into six groups. Two control groups received plain drinking water and a third control group received theophylline 0.8 mg/mL in the drinking water for 2 weeks. One group of animals drinking plain water was injected intraperitoneally (i.p.) with pentoxifylline 50 mg/kg per day for 2 weeks. The remaining groups were treated in the same manner and received single dose of CDDP 7 mg/kg, i.p., 1 week after starting theophylline and pentoxifylline treatment and all animals were killed 1 week after CDDP treatment. 3. Rats treated with CDDP developed nephrotoxicity, as demonstrated by increased kidney and testes weight as a percentage of total bodyweight, blood urea nitrogen and serum creatinine levels and decreased serum calcium and albumin levels. In addition, CDDP treatment resulted in an increase in the production of malondialdehyde (MDA) and decreases in total nitrate/nitrite levels, as well as depletion of reduced glutathione (GSH) content and glutathione peroxidase (GPX) activity in both the kidney and testes. Administration of theophylline in the drinking water to CDDP‐treated rats resulted in exacerbation of the indices of nephrotoxicity, depletion of GSH content and GPX activity levels, with increased MDA production and platinum accumulation in both the kidney and testes. However, pentoxifylline administration reduced CDDP‐induced biochemical changes and reduced platinum accumulation in both organs. Histopathological examination of the kidney revealed that CDDP treatment produced multifocal tubular atrophy, atypical reparative changes of the tubular epithelium and marked tubular necrosis. Animals treated with the theophylline/CDDP combination showed extensive widespread damage with intratubular calcification. However, pentoxifylline treatment ameliorated the overt changes induced by CDDP treatment. 4. Theophylline exacerbates the deleterious effects of CDDP on rat kidney and testes.

We attempted to identify the driving pathways in cisplatin-resistant ovarian cancer and develop targeted therapies to overcome this resistance. Using an integrated bioinformatics approach, a GSE15372 database from NCBI's Gene Expression Omnibus database was obtained for identifying differentially expressed genes (DEGs), in which 535 DEGs were found (407 up-regulated and 128 down-regulated) in association with ovarian cancer cisplatin-resistance. Gene ontology and pathway enrichment analyses further found that aberrant activation of EGFR/ErbB2 signaling was the driving event in resistant cells. A network of dysregulated genes was built based on these identified DEGs and protein-protein interaction network, which led to the identification of 7 potential inhibitors based on screening a 77 small molecule natural product library. Sanguinarine, alone and in combination with cisplatin, was found to significantly suppress the proliferation of wt/resistant ovarian cancer cells in vitro and the growth of parental and resistant ovarian xenograft tumors in vivo. Our study suggests that EGFR/ErbB2 activation is one of the driving pathways in developing cisplatin-resistance in ovarian cancer, and that sanguinarine has the potential to be developed as an effective therapy to overcome this therapeutic resistance.",3,12,923-939

Other work has elucidated that, in addition to promoting cardiac development, Nkx2-5 plays a larger role in mesodermal patterning although the transcriptional networks that govern this developmental patterning are undefined. By profiling early Nkx2-5-positive progenitor cells, we discovered that the progenitor pools of the bisected cardiac crescent are differentiating asynchronously. This asymmetry requires Nkx2-5 as it is lost in the Nkx2-5 mutant. Surprisingly, the posterior Hox genes Hoxa9 and Hoxa10 were expressed on the right side of the cardiac crescent, independently of Nkx2-5. We describe a novel, transient, and asymmetric cardiac-specific expression pattern of the posterior Hox genes, Hoxa9 and Hoxa10, and utilize the embryonic stem cell/embryoid body (ES/EB) model system to illustrate that Hoxa10 impairs cardiac differentiation.

Commitment to the cardiac muscle lineage, expression of most myofilament genes and myofibrillogenesis were not compromised. However, the myosin light-chain 2V gene (MLC2V) was not expressed in mutant hearts nor in mutant ES cell-derived cardiocytes. MLC2V expression normally occurs only in ventricular cells and is the earliest known molecular marker of ventricular differentiation. The regional expression in mutant hearts of two other ventricular markers, myosin heavy-chain beta and cyclin D2, indicated that not all ventricle-specific gene expression is dependent on Nkx2-5.

Thy-1 expression was examined by immunohistology of ventricular sections from normal and deoxycorticosterone acetate (DOCA)-salt hypertensive rats. Thy-1 immunostaining was detected in connective tissue on α8 integrin-positive and discoidin domain receptor 2 (DDR2)-positive fibroblasts. Enhanced Thy-1 staining was observed in the hearts of DOCA-salt rats particularly in areas of interstitial fibrosis. Cardiac mRNA analysis confirmed the increased Thy-1 expression. On cultured cardiac fibroblasts, flow cytofluorometry showed that cells, from primary culture to passage 4, were double positive for Thy-1 and for both α8 integrin and DDR2. Analysis of isolated lipid rafts by detergent-free sucrose gradient indicated that Thy-1 protein was probably located in these structures, but it may be located on a membrane microdomain slightly different from those of caveolin-1, as revealed by immunocytochemistry. Differentiation of fibroblasts into myofibroblasts being a characteristic of cardiac fibrosis and scarring, cardiac fibroblasts were stimulated in the presence of transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β) or connective tissue growth factor. While the expression of smooth muscle α-actin and α8 integrin doubled, Thy-1 level, measured by Western blotting and flow cytofluorometry, was not influenced by TGF-β. These results demonstrate that cardiac fibroblasts express Thy-1 and form a homogeneous population. Thy-1 expression also appears to be independent of fibroblast differentiation. The dichotomy between the increased Tthy-1 expression in the fibrotic area and the lack of association with fibroblast differentiation suggests that Thy-1 may represent a marker of fibroblast proliferation in the myocardium.",5,42,991-1000

Conflicting results have been reported regarding their respective function in mitochondrial iron–sulfur cluster biogenesis. We report here biophysical studies of the interaction of these two ferredoxins with other proteins involved in mitochondrial iron–sulfur cluster assembly. Results from nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy show that both FDX1 and FDX2 (in both their reduced and oxidized states) interact with the protein complex responsible for cluster assembly, which contains cysteine desulfurase (NFS1), ISD11 (also known as LYRM4), and acyl carrier protein (Acp). In all cases, ferredoxin residues close to the Fe–S cluster are involved in the interaction with this complex. Isothermal titration calorimetry results showed that FDX2 binds more tightly to the cysteine desulfurase complex than FDX1 does. The reduced form of each ferredoxin became oxidized in the presence of the cysteine desulfurase complex when l-cysteine was added, leading to its conversion to l-alanine and the generation of sulfide. In an in vitro reaction, the reduced form of each ferredoxin was found to support Fe–S cluster assembly on ISCU; the rate of cluster assembly was faster with FDX2 than with FDX1. Taken together, these results show that both FDX1 and FDX2 can function in Fe–S cluster assembly in vitro.",3,56,487-499

As a member of the [2Fe-2S] cluster-containing ferredoxin family, Fdx1 reduces mitochondrial cytochrome P450 enzymes, which then catalyze; e.g., the conversion of cholesterol to pregnenolone, aldosterone, and cortisol. The high protein sequence similarity between Fdx1 and its yeast adrenodoxin homologue (Yah1) suggested that Fdx1, like Yah1, may be involved in the biosynthesis of heme A and Fe/S clusters, two versatile and essential protein cofactors. Our study, employing RNAi technology to deplete human Fdx1, did not confirm this expectation. Instead, we identified a Fdx1-related mitochondrial protein, designated ferredoxin 2 (Fdx2) and found it to be essential for heme A and Fe/S protein biosynthesis. Unlike Fdx1, Fdx2 was unable to efficiently reduce mitochondrial cytochromes P450 and convert steroids, indicating that the two ferredoxin isoforms are highly specific for their substrates in distinct biochemical pathways. Moreover, Fdx2 deficiency had a severe impact, via impaired Fe/S protein biogenesis, on cellular iron homeostasis, leading to increased cellular iron uptake and iron accumulation in mitochondria. We conclude that mammals depend on two distinct mitochondrial ferredoxins for the specific production of either steroid hormones or heme A and Fe/S proteins.",26,107,11775-11780

Crooks,Tracey A. Rouault",Biochimica et Biophysica Acta (BBA) - Molecular Cell Research,,,Biochimica Et Biophysica Acta Bba - Mol Cell Res,0167-4889," Ferredoxins are iron–sulfur proteins that have been studied for decades because of their role in facilitating the monooxygenase reactions catalyzed by p450 enzymes. More recently, studies in bacteria and yeast have demonstrated important roles for ferredoxin and ferredoxin reductase in iron–sulfur cluster assembly. The human genome contains two homologous ferredoxins, ferredoxin 1 (FDX1) and ferredoxin 2 (FDX2 — formerly known as ferredoxin 1L). More recently, the roles of these two human ferredoxins in iron–sulfur cluster assembly were assessed, and it was concluded that FDX1 was important solely for its interaction with p450 enzymes to synthesize mitochondrial steroid precursors, whereas FDX2 was used for synthesis of iron–sulfur clusters, but not steroidogenesis. To further assess the role of the FDX–FDXR system in mammalian iron–sulfur cluster biogenesis, we performed siRNA studies on FDX1 and FDX2, on several human cell lines, using oligonucleotides identical to those previously used, along with new oligonucleotides that specifically targeted each gene. We concluded that both FDX1 and FDX2 were important in iron–sulfur cluster biogenesis. Loss of FDX1 activity disrupted activity of iron–sulfur cluster enzymes and cellular iron homeostasis, causing mitochondrial iron overload and cytosolic iron depletion. Moreover, knockdown of the sole human ferredoxin reductase, FDXR, diminished iron–sulfur cluster assembly and caused mitochondrial iron overload in conjunction with cytosolic depletion. Our studies suggest that interference with any of the three related genes, FDX1, FDX2 or FDXR, disrupts iron–sulfur cluster assembly and maintenance of normal cytosolic and mitochondrial iron homeostasis.",2,1823,484-492

The oncogenic RAS-selective lethal small molecule erastin triggers a unique iron-dependent form of nonapoptotic cell death that we term ferroptosis. Ferroptosis is dependent upon intracellular iron, but not other metals, and is morphologically, biochemically, and genetically distinct from apoptosis, necrosis, and autophagy. We identify the small molecule ferrostatin-1 as a potent inhibitor of ferroptosis in cancer cells and glutamate-induced cell death in organotypic rat brain slices, suggesting similarities between these two processes. Indeed, erastin, like glutamate, inhibits cystine uptake by the cystine/glutamate antiporter (system x c − ), creating a void in the antioxidant defenses of the cell and ultimately leading to iron-dependent, oxidative death. Thus, activation of ferroptosis results in the nonapoptotic destruction of certain cancer cells, whereas inhibition of this process may protect organisms from neurodegeneration.

Herein, we identify the essential ferredoxin Yah1p of Saccharomyces cerevisiae mitochondria as a central component of the Fe/S protein biosynthesis machinery. Depletion of Yah1p by regulated gene expression resulted in a 30-fold accumulation of iron within mitochondria, similar to what has been reported for other components involved in Fe/S protein biogenesis. Yah1p was shown to be required for the assembly of Fe/S proteins both inside mitochondria and in the cytosol. Apparently, at least one of the steps of Fe/S cluster biogenesis within mitochondria requires reduction by ferredoxin. Our findings lend support to the idea of a primary function of mitochondria in the biosynthesis of Fe/S proteins outside the organelle. To our knowledge, Yah1p is the first member of the ferredoxin family for which a function in Fe/S cluster formation has been established.

Protein expression was induced by galactose and repressed to undetectable levels in the absence of galactose, although cells grew quite well in the absence of inducer. Under noninducing conditions, cellular iron uptake was dysregulated, exhibiting a failure to repress in response to medium iron. Iron trafficking within the cell was also disturbed. Exposure of Arh1p-depleted cells to increasing iron concentrations during growth led to drastic increases in mitochondrial iron, indicating a loss of homeostatic control. Activity of aconitase, a prototype Fe-S protein, was deficient at all concentrations of mitochondrial iron, although the protein level was unaltered. Heme protein deficiencies were exacerbated in the iron-loaded mitochondria, suggesting a toxic side effect of accumulated iron. Finally, a time course correlated the cellular depletion of Arh1p with the coordinated appearance of various mutant phenotypes including dysregulated cellular iron uptake, deficiency of Fe-S protein activities in mitochondria and cytoplasm, and deficiency of hemoproteins. Thus, Arh1p is required for control of cellular and mitochondrial iron levels and for the activities of Fe-S cluster proteins.",2,276,1503-1509

To clarify the role of LPO in different modes of RCD, we studied in a comprehensive approach the differential involvement of reactive oxygen species (ROS), phospholipid peroxidation products, and lipid ROS flux in the major prototype modes of RCD viz. apoptosis, necroptosis, ferroptosis, and pyroptosis. LC-MS oxidative lipidomics revealed robust peroxidation of three classes of phospholipids during ferroptosis with quantitative predominance of phosphatidylethanolamine species. Incomparably lower amounts of phospholipid peroxidation products were found in any of the other modes of RCD. Nonetheless, a strong increase in lipid ROS levels was detected in non-canonical pyroptosis, but only during cell membrane rupture. In contrast to ferroptosis, lipid ROS apparently was not involved in non-canonical pyroptosis execution nor in the release of IL-1β and IL-18, while clear dependency on CASP11 and GSDMD was observed. Our data demonstrate that ferroptosis is the only mode of RCD that depends on excessive phospholipid peroxidation for its cytotoxicity. In addition, our results also highlight the importance of performing kinetics and using different methods to monitor the occurrence of LPO. This should open the discussion on the implication of particular LPO events in relation to different modes of RCD.",10,11,922

Although dysfunction of mitochondria has been implicated in tumorigenesis, little is known about the roles of mitochondrial dynamics in metastasis, the major cause of cancer death. In the present study, we found a marked upregulation of mitochondrial fission protein dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1) expression in human invasive breast carcinoma and metastases to lymph nodes. Compared with non-metastatic breast cancer cells, mitochondria also were more fragmented in metastatic breast cancer cells that express higher levels of total and active Drp1 and less mitochondrial fusion protein 1 (Mfn1). Silencing Drp1 or overexpression of Mfn1 resulted in mitochondria elongation or clusters, respectively, and significantly suppressed metastatic abilities of breast cancer cells. In contrast, silencing Mfn proteins led to mitochondrial fragmentation and enhanced metastatic abilities of breast cancer cells. Interestingly, these manipulations of mitochondrial dynamics altered the subcellular distribution of mitochondria in breast cancer cells. For example, silencing Drp1 or overexpression of Mfn1 inhibited lamellipodia formation, a key step for cancer metastasis, and suppressed chemoattractant-induced recruitment of mitochondria to lamellipodial regions. Conversely, silencing Mfn proteins resulted in more cell spreading and lamellipodia formation, causing accumulation of more mitochondria in lamellipodia regions. More importantly, treatment with a mitochondrial uncoupling agent or adenosine triphosphate synthesis inhibitor reduced lamellipodia formation and decreased breast cancer cell migration and invasion, suggesting a functional importance of mitochondria in breast cancer metastasis. Together, our findings show a new role and mechanism for regulation of cancer cell migration and invasion by mitochondrial dynamics.

This change activates AMPK, which in turn inhibits YAP/TAZ. Mouse models and human pathological data show that MYC enhances AMPK and suppresses YAP/TAZ activity in mammary tumors.",6,28,743-757

Besides exerting central bioenergetic functions, mitochondria provide indeed building blocks for tumor anabolism, control redox and calcium homeostasis, participate in transcriptional regulation, and govern cell death. Thus, mitochondria constitute promising targets for the development of novel anticancer agents. However, tumors arise, progress, and respond to therapy in the context of an intimate crosstalk with the host immune system, and many immunological functions rely on intact mitochondrial metabolism.

In particular, through distinct mechanisms, tumors with increased mitochondrial fragmentation or connectivity are hypersensitive to SMAC mimetics, a class of compounds that induce apoptosis through inhibition of IAPs and for which robust sensitivity biomarkers remain to be identified. Further, because driver oncogenes exert dominant control over mitochondrial dynamics, oncogene-targeted therapies can be used to sensitize tumors to SMAC mimetics via their effects on fission/fusion dynamics. Collectively, these data demonstrate that perturbations to the mitochondrial dynamics network induce targetable vulnerabilities across diverse human tumors and, more broadly, suggest that the altered structures, activities, and trafficking of cellular organelles may facilitate additional cancer therapeutic opportunities.

However, determined characteristics of PCD such as loss in mitochondrial reductase activity or cytolysis can be induced in enucleated cells, indicating cytoplasmic PCD control. Here we report a sequential disregulation of mitochondrial function that precedes cell shrinkage and nuclear fragmentation. A first cyclosporin A-inhibitable step of ongoing PCD is characterized by a reduction of mitochondrial transmembrane potential, as determined by specific fluorochromes (5,5',6,6'-tetrachloro-1,1',3,3'-tetraethylbenzimidazolcarbocyanine++ + iodide; 3,3'dihexyloxacarbocyanine iodide). Cytofluorometrically purified cells with reduced mitochondrial transmembrane potential are initially incapable of oxidizing hydroethidine (HE) into ethidium. Upon short-term in vitro culture, such cells acquire the capacity of HE oxidation, thus revealing a second step of PCD marked by mitochondrial generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). This step can be selectively inhibited by rotenone and ruthenium red yet is not affected by cyclosporin A. Finally, cells reduce their volume, a step that is delayed by radical scavengers, indicating the implication of ROS in the apoptotic process. This sequence of alterations accompanying early PCD is found in very different models of apoptosis induction: glucocorticoid-induced death of lymphocytes, activation-induced PCD of T cell hybridomas, and tumor necrosis factor-induced death of U937 cells. Transfection with the antiapoptotic protooncogene Bcl-2 simultaneously inhibits mitochondrial alterations and apoptotic cell death triggered by steroids or ceramide. In vivo injection of fluorochromes such as 5,5',6,6'-tetrachloro-1,1',3,3'-tetraethylbenzimidazolcarbocyanine iodide; 3,3'dihexyloxacarbocyanine iodide; or HE allows for the detection of cells that are programmed for death but still lack nuclear DNA fragmentation. In particular, assessment of mitochondrial ROS generation provides an accurate picture of PCD-mediated lymphocyte depletion. In conclusion, alterations of mitochondrial function constitute an important feature of early PCD.",2,182,367-377

Here we report that one alteration that can be detected among splenocytes stimulated with lymphocyte-depleting doses of dexamethasone (DEX) in vivo is a reduced uptake of 3,3'dihexyloxacarbocyanine iodide (DiOC6[3]), a fluorochrome which incorporates into cells dependent upon their mitochondrial transmembrane potential (delta psi m). In contrast, ex vivo isolated splenocytes still lacked established signs of programmed cell death (PCD):DNA degradation into high or low molecular weight fragments, ultrastructural changes of chromatin arrangement and endoplasmatic reticulum, loss in viability, or accumulation of intracellular peroxides. Moreover, no changes in cell membrane potential could be detected. A reduced delta psi m has been observed in response to different agents inducing lymphoid cell depletion in vivo (superantigen and glucocorticoids [GC]), in mature T and B lymphocytes, as well as their precursors. DEX treatment in vivo, followed by cytofluorometric purification of viable delta psi mlow splenic T cells ex vivo, revealed that this fraction of cells is irreversibly committed to undergoing DNA fragmentation. Immediately after purification neither delta psi mlow, nor delta psi mhigh cells, exhibit detectable DNA fragmentation. However, after short-term culture (37 degrees C, 1 h) delta psi mlow cells show endonucleolysis, followed by cytolysis several hours later. Incubation of delta psi mlow cells in the presence of excess amount of the GC receptor antagonist RU38486 (which displaces DEX from the GC receptor), cytokines that inhibit DEX-induced cell death, or cycloheximide fails to prevent cytolysis. The antioxidant, N-acetylcysteine, as well as linomide, an agent that effectively inhibits DEX or superantigen-induced lymphocyte depletion in vivo, also stabilize the DiOC6(3) uptake. In contrast, the endonuclease inhibitor, aurintricarboxylic acid acts at later stages of apoptosis and only retards the transition from the viable delta psi mlow to the nonviable fraction. Altogether, these data suggest a sequence of PCD-associated events in which a reduction in delta psi m constitutes an obligate irreversible step of ongoing lymphocyte death, preceding other alterations of cellular physiology, and thus allowing for the ex vivo assessment of PCD.",5,181,1661-1672

Cytoplasmic structures including mitochondria have been shown to participate in the control of apoptotic nuclear disintegration. Before cells exhibit common signs of nuclear apoptosis (chromatin condensation and endonuclease-mediated DNA fragmentation), they undergo a reduction of the mitochondrial transmembrane potential (delta psi m) that may be due to the opening of mitochondrial permeability transition (PT) pores. Here, we present direct evidence indicating that mitochondrial PT constitutes a critical early event of the apoptotic process. In a cell-free system combining purified mitochondria and nuclei, mitochondria undergoing PT suffice to induce chromatin condensation and DNA fragmentation. Induction of PT by pharmacological agents augments the apoptosis-inducing potential of mitochondria. In contrast, prevention of PT by pharmacological agents impedes nuclear apoptosis, both in vitro and in vivo. Mitochondria from hepatocytes or lymphoid cells undergoing apoptosis, but not those from normal cells, induce disintegration of isolated Hela nuclei. A specific ligand of the mitochondrial adenine nucleotide translocator (ANT), bongkreik acid, inhibits PT and reduces apoptosis induction by mitochondria in a cell-free system. Moreover, it inhibits the induction of apoptosis in intact cells. Several pieces of evidence suggest that the proto-oncogene product Bcl-2 inhibits apoptosis by preventing mitochondrial PT. First, to inhibit nuclear apoptosis, Bcl-2 must be localized in mitochondrial but not nuclear membranes. Second, transfection-enforced hyperexpression of Bcl-2 directly abolishes the induction of mitochondrial PT in response to a protonophore, a pro-oxidant, as well as to the ANT ligand atractyloside, correlating with its apoptosis-inhibitory effect. In conclusion, mitochondrial PT appears to be a critical step of the apoptotic cascade.",4,183,1533-1544

A previous study showed that Met enhanced cytotoxic activity of cisplatin (Cis) in cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) in association with the activation of AMP-activated protein kinase and suppression of Akt-mTOR. However, these effects do not entirely explain the observed chemosensitizing effect. The present study investigated the interaction of Met and Cis over the enhanced antitumor effect. Main methods KKU-100 and KKU-M156 cells were used in the study. Cytotoxicity was assessed by acridine orange-ethidium bromide staining. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) and mitochondrial transmembrane potential (Δψm) were measured by dihydroethidium and JC-1 fluorescent methods. Cellular glutathione (GSH) and redox ratio were analyzed by enzymatic coupling assay. Proteins associated with antioxidant system and cell death were evaluated by western immunoblot. Key findings Cytotoxicity of Cis was enhanced by Met in association with ROS formation and GSH redox stress. The antioxidants, N-acetylcysteine and TEMPOL, and MPTP inhibitor, cyclosporine, attenuated cytotoxicity in association with suppression of ROS formation and the losses of Δψm. Met in combination with Cis suppressed expression of Nrf2 and altered the expression of Bcl2 family proteins.

Mechanistically, cysteine deprivation leads to mitochondrial membrane potential hyperpolarization and lipid peroxide accumulation. Inhibition of mitochondrial TCA cycle or electron transfer chain (ETC) mitigated mitochondrial membrane potential hyperpolarization, lipid peroxide accumulation, and ferroptosis.

Biochemical processes within the mitochondria of both cancer cells and the stromal cells with which they interact are critical for each metastatic hallmark. We unravel complex dynamics in mitochondrial contributions to cancer, which are context-dependent and capable of either promoting metastasis or being leveraged to prevent it at various points of the metastatic cascade.

Res.,0360-4012,"Diminished activity of the α‐ketoglutarate dehydrogenase complex (KGDHC), an important component of the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, occurs in several neurological diseases. The effect of specific KGDHC inhibitors [phosphonoethyl ester of succinyl phosphonate (PESP) and the carboxy ethyl ester of succinyl phosphonate (CESP)] on [1‐13C]glucose and [U‐13C]glutamate metabolism in intact cerebellar granule neurons was investigated. Both inhibitors decreased formation of [4‐13C]glutamate from [1‐13C]glucose, a reduction in label in glutamate derived from [1‐13C]glucose/[U‐13C]glutamate through a second turn of the TCA cycle and a decline in the amounts of γ‐aminobutyric acid (GABA), aspartate, and alanine. PESP decreased formation of [U‐13C]aspartate and total glutathione, whereas CESP decreased concentrations of valine and leucine. The findings are consistent with decreased KGDHC activity; increased α‐ketoglutarate formation; increased transamination of α‐ketoglutarate with valine, leucine, and GABA; and new equilibrium position of the aspartate aminotransferase reaction. Overall, the findings also suggest that some carbon derived from α‐ketoglutarate may bypass the block in the TCA cycle at KGDHC by means of the GABA shunt and/or conversion of valine to succinate. The results suggest the potential of succinyl phosphonate esters for modeling the biochemical and pathophysiological consequences of reduced KGDHC activity in brain diseases. © 2006 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.",3,83,450-458

The hyperactive metabolism of cancer cells supports their extreme adaptability and plasticity and facilitates resistance to common anticancer therapies. In spite the potential relevance of a metastasis metabolic control therapy, so far, limited experience is available in this direction. Here, we evaluated the effect of the recently described α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase (KGDH) inhibitor, (S)-2-[(2,6-dichlorobenzoyl) amino] succinic acid (AA6), in an orthotopic mouse model of breast cancer 4T1 and in other human breast cancer cell lines. In all conditions, AA6 altered Krebs cycle causing intracellular α-ketoglutarate (α-KG) accumulation. Consequently, the activity of the α-KG-dependent epigenetic enzymes, including the DNA demethylation ten-eleven translocation translocation hydroxylases (TETs), was increased. In mice, AA6 injection reduced metastasis formation and increased 5hmC levels in primary tumours. Moreover, in vitro and in vivo treatment with AA6 determined an α-KG accumulation paralleled by an enhanced production of nitric oxide (NO). This epigenetically remodelled metabolic environment efficiently counteracted the initiating steps of tumour invasion inhibiting the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Mechanistically, AA6 treatment could be linked to upregulation of the NO-sensitive anti-metastatic miRNA 200 family and down-modulation of EMT-associated transcription factor Zeb1 and its CtBP1 cofactor. This scenario led to a decrease of the matrix metalloproteinase 3 (MMP3) and to an impairment of 4T1 aggressiveness. Overall, our data suggest that AA6 determines an α-KG-dependent epigenetic regulation of the TET–miR200–Zeb1/CtBP1–MMP3 axis providing an anti-metastatic effect in a mouse model of breast cancer-associated metastasis.",7,9,756

However, we currently do not understand the mechanism by which copper brought into cells as ES–Cu(II) is released and delivered to cuproenzymes present in different subcellular compartments. Here, we have utilized a combination of genetic, biochemical, and cell-biological approaches to demonstrate that intracellular release of copper from ES occurs inside and outside of mitochondria. The mitochondrial matrix reductase, FDX1, catalyzes the reduction of ES–Cu(II) to Cu(I), releasing it into mitochondria where it is bioavailable for the metalation of mitochondrial cuproenzyme— cytochrome c oxidase. Consistently, ES fails to rescue cytochrome c oxidase abundance and activity in copper-deficient cells lacking FDX1. In the absence of FDX1, the ES-dependent increase in cellular copper is attenuated but not abolished. Thus, ES-mediated copper delivery to nonmitochondrial cuproproteins continues even in the absence of FDX1, suggesting alternate mechanism(s) of copper release. Importantly, we demonstrate that this mechanism of copper transport by ES is distinct from other clinically used copper-transporting drugs. Our study uncovers a unique mode of intracellular copper delivery by ES and may further aid in repurposing this anticancer drug for copper deficiency disorders.",10,120,e2216722120

Cuproptosis is a new mechanism of cell death, which is closely related to tumor progression, prognosis and immunity. The identification of prognostic markers related to cuproptosis in KIRC may provide targets for treatment and improve the prognosis of KIRC patients. Methods: Ten cuproptosis-related genes were analyzed for differential expression in KIRC-TCGA and a prognostic model was constructed. Nomogram diagnostic model was used to screen independent prognostic molecules. The screened molecules were verified in multiple datasets (GSE36895 and GSE53757), and in KIRC tumor tissues by RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry (IHC). Clinical correlation of cuproptosis-related independent prognostic molecules was analyzed. According to the molecular expression, the two groups were divided into high and low expression groups, and the differences of immune checkpoint and tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) between the two groups were compared by EPIC algorithm. The potential Immune checkpoint blocking (ICB) response of high and low expression groups was predicted by the “TIDE” algorithm. Results: FDX1 and DLAT were protective factors, while CDKN2A was a risk factor. FDX1 was an independent prognostic molecule by Nomogram, and low expressed in tumor tissues compared with adjacent tissues (p < 0.05). FDX1 was positively correlated with CD274, HAVCR2, PDCD1LG2, and negatively correlated with CTLA4, LAG3, and PDCD1. The TIDE score of low-FDX1 group was higher than that of high-FDX1 group. The abundance of CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells and Endothelial cells in FDX1-low group was lower than that in FDX1-high group (p < 0.05). Conclusion: FDX1, as a key cuproptosis-related gene, was also an independent prognostic molecule of KIRC. FDX1 might become an interesting biomarker and potential therapeutic target for KIRC.",,14,1071694

In this study, we established a novel scoring system based on 10 cuproptosis‐related genes (CRGs) to predict the prognosis and immune landscape of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). The RNA‐seq data of HNSCC patients were downloaded from the GEO and TCGA databases and were merged into a novel HNSCC cohort. Multiomics landscape analyses were conducted, including tumor mutation burden (TMB), copy number variations and the interaction network of CRGs. Patients were then divided into different cuproptosis subtypes based on the expression of 10 CRGs and subsequently regrouped into novel gene clusters referring to differentially expressed genes. A cuproptosis score (CS) system was established using principal component analysis. The CIBERSORT, ssGSEA and ESTIMATE algorithms were used to assess the tumor immune microenvironment. Moreover, the immunotherapeutic and chemotherapeutic responses were assessed. Patients were divided into three cuproptosis subtypes and subsequently regrouped into three gene clusters, reflecting different immune infiltration. Assessed by the CS system, those with higher CSs exhibited worse prognosis and higher TMB frequency. Nevertheless, the immune‐related analysis revealed patients in the low‐CS group appeared immunosuppressive and easily suffered from immune escape. High CSs possibly show high expression of immune checkpoint genes and enhance chemotherapy sensitivity to cisplatin, docetaxel, and gemcitabine. We established a novel scoring system to predict the prognosis and immune landscape of HNSCC patients.

In the past, elesclomol was recognized as an inducer of oxidative stress, but now it has also been found to suppress cancer by inducing cuproptosis. Elesclomol’s anticancer activity is determined by the dependence of cancer on mitochondrial metabolism. The mitochondrial metabolism of cancer stem cells, cancer cells resistant to platinum drugs, proteasome inhibitors, molecularly targeted drugs, and cancer cells with inhibited glycolysis was significantly enhanced. Elesclomol exhibited tremendous toxicity to all three kinds of cells. Elesclomol's toxicity to cells is highly dependent on its transport of extracellular copper ions, a process involved in cuproptosis. The discovery of cuproptosis has perfected the specific cancer suppressor mechanism of elesclomol. For some time, elesclomol failed to yield favorable results in oncology clinical trials, but its safety in clinical application was confirmed. Research progress on the relationship between elesclomol, mitochondrial metabolism and cuproptosis provides a possibility to explore the reapplication of elesclomol in the clinic. New clinical trials should selectively target cancer types with high mitochondrial metabolism and attempt to combine elesclomol with platinum, proteasome inhibitors, molecularly targeted drugs, or glycolysis inhibitors.

Moreover, redox metabolism is also systematically altered in tumor cells. Indeed, there is growing reason to believe that tumor-specific alteration of redox control of metabolism will be central to understanding and attacking malignancy. We report here that lipoate analog CPI-613 attacks a gate-keeping, lipoate-using metabolic enzyme, alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase (KGDH), by a redox mechanism selectively in tumors cells. CPI-613 inhibited KGDH function strongly and rapidly, selectively in tumor cells. Moreover, CPI-613 induced a correspondingly rapid, powerful redox signal in tumor cell mitochondria. This signal was associated with redox modification of KGDH (including extensive enzyme glutathionylation and redox blockage of enzyme lipoate sulfhydryls), correlating with KGDH inactivation. The source of this tumor-specific mitochondrial redox modulatory signal was not electron transport complexes (I or III), but was largely or entirely the E3 (dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase) component of dehydrogenases, including KGDH. Finally, we demonstrated that KGDH activity was redox regulated (in tumor cells), as expected if a tumor-specific redox process (auto)regulates KGDH. Our data demonstrate that lipoate analog CPI-613 attacks redox control of KGDH activity in tumor cells, perhaps by modulation of an existing lipoate-sensitive allosteric process normally governing tumor cell KGDH activity. Together with its previously reported, mechanistically distinct (non-redox) effects on the other major, lipoate-using mitochondrial metabolic enzyme, pyruvate dehydrogenase, CPI-613’s KGDH effects indicate that this agent simultaneously attacks multiple central, essential components of tumor cell metabolic regulation.",1,2,4

Nice,Jie Lin,Canhua Huang",Molecular Oncology,,,Mol Oncol,1574-7891,"Cancer cells reprogram their copper metabolism to adapt to adverse microenvironments, such as oxidative stress. The copper chelator elesclomol has been reported to have considerable anticancer efficacy, but the underlying mechanisms remain largely unknown. In this study, we found that elesclomol‐mediated copper overload inhibits colorectal cancer (CRC) both in vitro and in vivo. Elesclomol alone promotes the degradation of the copper transporter copper‐transporting ATPase 1 (ATP7A), which retards the proliferation of CRC cells. This property distinguishes it from several other copper chelators. Combinational treatment of elesclomol and copper leads to copper retention within mitochondria due to ATP7A loss, leading to reactive oxygen species accumulation, which in turn promotes the degradation of SLC7A11, thus further enhancing oxidative stress and consequent ferroptosis in CRC cells. This effect accounts for the robust antitumour activity of elesclomol against CRC, which can be reversed by the administration of antioxidants and ferroptosis inhibitors, as well as the overexpression of ATP7A. In summary, our findings indicate that elesclomol‐induced copper chelation inhibits CRC by targeting ATP7A and regulating ferroptosis. In this study, we describe the molecular mechanisms by which elesclomol‐mediated copper (Cu2+) overload inhibits colorectal cancer (CRC) both in vitro and in vivo. Elesclomol elevated Cu2+ levels in mitochondria and decreased the expression of the Cu2+ transporter ATP7A, leading to Cu2+ retention and the subsequent accumulation of reactive oxygen species. The process promoted the degradation of SLC7A11, which further enhanced oxidative stress and induced ferroptosis in CRC cells.",12,15,3527-3544

In a phase II randomized, double-blinded, controlled, multi-center trial in 81 patients with stage IV metastatic melanoma, treatment with elesclomol plus paclitaxel showed a statistically significant doubling of progression-free survival time compared with treatment with paclitaxel alone. Although elesclomol displays significant therapeutic activity in the clinic, the mechanism underlying its anticancer activity has not been defined previously. Here, we show that elesclomol induces apoptosis in cancer cells through the induction of oxidative stress. Treatment of cancer cells in vitro with elesclomol resulted in the rapid generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the induction of a transcriptional gene profile characteristic of an oxidative stress response. Inhibition of oxidative stress by the antioxidant N-acetylcysteine blocked the induction of gene transcription by elesclomol. In addition, N-acetylcysteine blocked drug-induced apoptosis, indicating that ROS generation is the primary mechanism responsible for the proapoptotic activity of elesclomol. Excessive ROS production and elevated levels of oxidative stress are critical biochemical alterations that contribute to cancer cell growth. Thus, the induction of oxidative stress by elesclomol exploits this unique characteristic of cancer cells by increasing ROS levels beyond a threshold that triggers cell death.

Here we report the first description of selective mitochondrial ROS induction by elesclomol in cancer cells based on the unique physicochemical properties of the compound. Elesclomol preferentially chelates copper (Cu) outside of cells and enters as elesclomol–Cu(II). The elesclomol–Cu(II) complex then rapidly and selectively transports the copper to mitochondria. In this organelle Cu(II) is reduced to Cu(I), followed by subsequent ROS generation. Upon dissociation from the complex, elesclomol is effluxed from cells and repeats shuttling elesclomol–Cu complexes from the extracellular to the intracellular compartments, leading to continued copper accumulation within mitochondria. An optimal range of redox potentials exhibited by copper chelates of elesclomol and its analogs correlated with the elevation of mitochondrial Cu(I) levels and cytotoxic activity, suggesting that redox reduction of the copper triggers mitochondrial ROS induction. Importantly the mitochondrial selectivity exhibited by elesclomol is a distinct characteristic of the compound that is not shared by other chelators, including disulfiram. Together these findings highlight a unique mechanism of action with important implications for cancer therapy.",10,52,2142-2150

The mechanism of drug resistance to cisplatin is complex and historically has been difficult to overcome. We report here that cisplatin resistant lung cancer cell lines possess high basal levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) when compared to normal cells and their parental cell counterparts. These resistant cells also have low thioredoxin (TRX) levels which may be one of the contributory factors to high ROS. N′1,N′3-dimethyl-N′1,N′3-bis(phenylcarbonothioyl) propanedihydrazide (elesclomol), an agent known to increase ROS is selectively toxic to cisplatin-resistant cells, while sparing normal cells and the parental counterpart. The cytotoxic effect of elesclomol in resistant cells is accompanied by further decreases in TRX and glutathione (GSH) antioxidant systems, while opposite results were found in parental cells. The ID50 of elesclomol in cisplatin-resistant cells ranged from 5–10 nM, which is well within clinically achievable ranges. N-Acetylcysteine (NAC), which is known to neutralize ROS, can abolish the cytotoxic effect of elesclomol, suggesting that the cytotoxic effect results from increased ROS. Overall, our data suggest that elesclomol selectively kills cisplatin-resistant tumor cells through increased ROS.

Sabatini,Kıvanç Birsoy,Richard Possemato",Nature,,,Nature,0028-0836,"Cancers growing in high-oxygen environments, such as lung adenocarcinomas, select for the iron–sulfur cluster synthesizing enzyme NFS1 to support malignant proliferation and to protect from oxidative damage. Cancer cells often select environment-specific adaptations in order to grow in different contexts. The authors show that tumours growing in high oxygen settings, such as lung cancers or metastasis, usually show elevated NFS1 signalling. NFS1 maintains the iron–sulfur clusters in proteins that are essential for protecting them from oxidative damage. Inactivating NFS1 or iron–sulfur clusters can trigger ferroptosis, a non-apoptotic form of cell death, in cancer cells. Environmental nutrient levels impact cancer cell metabolism, resulting in context-dependent gene essentiality1,2. Here, using loss-of-function screening based on RNA interference, we show that environmental oxygen levels are a major driver of differential essentiality between in vitro model systems and in vivo tumours. Above the 3–8% oxygen concentration typical of most tissues, we find that cancer cells depend on high levels of the iron–sulfur cluster biosynthetic enzyme NFS1. Mammary or subcutaneous tumours grow despite suppression of NFS1, whereas metastatic or primary lung tumours do not. Consistent with a role in surviving the high oxygen environment of incipient lung tumours, NFS1 lies in a region of genomic amplification present in lung adenocarcinoma and is most highly expressed in well-differentiated adenocarcinomas. NFS1 activity is particularly important for maintaining the iron–sulfur co-factors present in multiple cell-essential proteins upon exposure to oxygen compared to other forms of oxidative damage. Furthermore, insufficient iron–sulfur cluster maintenance robustly activates the iron-starvation response and, in combination with inhibition of glutathione biosynthesis, triggers ferroptosis, a non-apoptotic form of cell death. Suppression of NFS1 cooperates with inhibition of cysteine transport to trigger ferroptosis in vitro and slow tumour growth. Therefore, lung adenocarcinomas select for expression of a pathway that confers resistance to high oxygen tension and protects cells from undergoing ferroptosis in response to oxidative damage.",7682,551,639-643

Iron overload is often associated with haematological diseases which require regular blood transfusion/phlebotomy, and it represents a common complication in thalassaemic patients. Major damages predominantly occur in the liver and the heart, leading to a specific form of cell death recently named ferroptosis. Different from apoptosis, necrosis, and autophagy, ferroptosis is strictly dependent on iron and reactive oxygen species, with a dysregulation of mitochondrial structure/function. Susceptibility to ferroptosis is dependent on intracellular antioxidant capacity and varies according to the different cell types. Chemotherapy-induced cardiotoxicity has been proven to be mediated predominantly by iron accumulation and ferroptosis, whereas there is evidence about the role of ferritin in protecting cardiomyocytes from ferroptosis and consequent heart failure. Another paradigmatic organ for transfusion-associated complication due to iron overload is the liver, in which the role of ferroptosis is yet to be elucidated. Some studies report a role of ferroptosis in the initiation of hepatic inflammation processes while others provide evidence about an involvement in several pathologies including immune-related hepatitis and acute liver failure. In this manuscript, we aim to review the literature to address putative common features between the response to ferroptosis in the heart and liver.

Ferroptosis is a novel form of cell death characterized by the lethal accumulation of iron and lipid peroxidation, which is associated with many diseases. Our study addressed the potential role played by ferroptosis and iron accumulation in the progression of pulmonary fibrosis. We found that the inducers of pulmonary fibrosis and injury, namely, bleomycin (BLM) and lipopolysaccharide (LPS), induced ferroptosis of lung epithelial cells. Both the ferroptosis inhibitor liproxstatin-1 (Lip-1) and the iron chelator deferoxamine (DFO) alleviated the symptoms of pulmonary fibrosis induced by bleomycin or LPS. TGF-β stimulation upregulated the expression of transferrin receptor protein 1 (TFRC) in the human lung fibroblast cell line (MRC-5) and mouse primary lung fibroblasts, resulting in increased intracellular Fe2+, which promoted the transformation of fibroblasts into myofibroblasts. Mechanistically, TGF-β enhanced the expression and nuclear localization of the transcriptional coactivator tafazzin (TAZ), which combined with the transcription factor TEA domain protein (TEAD)-4 to promote the transcription of TFRC. In addition, elevated Fe2+ failed to induce the ferroptosis of fibroblasts, which might be related to the regulation of iron export and lipid metabolism. Finally, we specifically knocked out TFRC expression in fibroblasts in mice, and compared with those in the control mice, the symptoms of pulmonary fibrosis were reduced in the knockout mice after bleomycin induction. Collectively, these findings suggest the therapeutic potential of ferroptosis inhibitors and iron chelators in treating pulmonary fibrosis.",,57,102509

The precise mechanism by which this activation and the subsequent structural changes in the protein occur is currently unknown. In addition to triggering the onset of apoptosis, oxidative stress generates oxidized lipids whose impact on mitochondrial membrane integrity and the activity of membrane-associated Bax is unclear. We therefore devised a model system that mimics oxidative stress conditions by incorporating oxidized phospholipids (OxPls) into mitochondria-like liposomes, and studied the OxPls' impact on Bax-membrane interactions. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) was used to study membrane organization and protein stability, while conformational changes in the protein upon contact with lipid vesicles were monitored using far-UV circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy. The thermograms for liposomes containing the OxPl 1-palmitoyl-2-azelaoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (PazePC) differed dramatically from those for unmodified liposomes. Moreover, Bax exhibited enhanced thermal stability in the presence of the modified liposomes, indicating that it interacted strongly with PazePC-containing membranes. The presence of PazePC also increased the α-helical character of Bax compared to the protein alone or with PazePC-free vesicles, at 10°C, 20°C, and 37°C. Presumably, the presence of PazePC-like OxPls a) increases the population of membrane-associated Bax and b) facilitates the protein's insertion into the membrane by distorting the bilayer's organization, as seen by solid-state high-resolution 1H and 31P magic angle spinning nuclear magnetic resonance (MAS NMR) spectroscopy.",11,1818,2718-2724

Intracellular oxidative stress causes the translocation of Bax, a pro-apoptotic family member, to the mitochondrial outer membrane (MOM) where it induces membrane permeabilization. Oxidized phospholipids (OxPls) generated in the MOM during oxidative stress directly affect the onset and progression of mitochondria-mediated apoptosis. Here we use MOM-mimicking lipid vesicles doped with varying concentrations of 1-palmitoyl-2-azelaoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (PazePC), an OxPl species known to significantly enhance Bax-membrane association, to investigate three key aspects of Bax's action at the MOM: 1) induction of Bax pores in membranes without additional mediator proteins, 2) existence of a threshold OxPl concentration required for Bax-membrane action and 3) mechanism by which PazePC disturbs membrane organization to facilitate Bax penetration. Fluorescence leakage studies revealed that Bax-induced leakage, especially its rate, increased with the vesicles' PazePC content without any detectable threshold neither for OxPl nor Bax. Moreover, the leakage rate correlated with the Bax to lipid ratio and the PazePC content. Solid state NMR studies and calorimetric experiments on the lipid vesicles confirmed that OxPl incorporation disrupted the membrane's organization, enabling Bax to penetrate into the membrane. In addition, 15N cross polarization (CP) and insensitive nuclei enhanced by polarization transfer (INEPT) MAS NMR experiments using uniformly 15N-labeled Bax revealed dynamically restricted helical segments of Bax embedded in the membrane, while highly flexible protein segments were located outside or at the membrane surface.",6,1858,1288-1297

The present study was conducted to evaluate the intracellular mechanisms involved in the control of hen granulosa cell PA activity through the use of physiological and pharmacological agents. Treatment of granulosa cells with increasing doses (1, 10, and 50 ng/tube) of ovine LH resulted in a significant reduction of PA activity, which was accompanied by an increase in intracellular levels of cAMP. Furthermore, the effects of LH were potentiated by cotreatment with the phosphodiesterase inhibitor 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (0.1 mM). Exposure of cells to increasing concentrations of the adenylyl cyclase activator forskolin (0.005, 0.01, 0.05, and 0.1 mM) resulted in a significant reduction in PA activity at all doses given. Similarly, the presence of the cAMP analog 8-bromo-cAMP (0.005, 0.01, 0.05, 0.1, 0.5, 1.5, and 10 mM) caused a dose-dependent inhibition of PA activity from 0.005 to 1.0 mM, further suggesting the involvement of cAMP in the inhibitory regulation of hen granulosa cell PA activity. The induction of intracellular calcium mobilization through the use of the calcium ionophore A23187 (0.1, 0.5, 1, and 2 microM) resulted in a dose-dependent suppression of PA activity. By contrast, treatment of granulosa cells with the tumor-promoting phorbol ester phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA; 0.5, 5, 10, 25, and 50 micrograms/tube), a compound that activates protein kinase-C, stimulated PA activity in a dose-dependent fashion; a non-tumor-promoting phorbol ester (phorbol 13-monoacetate; 0.5, 10, and 50 ng/tube) was without effect. Coincubation of granulosa cells with a submaximal dose of PMA (5 ng/tube) and low concentrations of A23187 (0.001, 0.005, 0.01, and 0.05 microM) could not significantly enhance the stimulatory effects of PMA on PA activity; however, higher concentrations of the ionophore (0.1, 0.5, and 1.0 microM) completely abolished PMA-stimulated PA activity. The stimulatory effects of PMA could also be eliminated by cotreatment with a protein kinase-C inhibitor (H-7; 100 microM), a mRNA transcription blocker (actinomycin-D; 5 micrograms/tube), or a protein synthesis inhibitor (cycloheximide; 50 micrograms/tube).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",3,123,1433-1441

Although recent data have shown that apoptosis in granulosa cells of ovarian follicles can be hormonally manipulated, the molecular mechanisms responsible for transducing external signals remain to be elucidated. Herein we have characterized changes in the expression of the bcl-2 protooncogene (an inhibitor of apoptosis), the bax gene (an inducer of apoptosis), and the bcl-x gene (which encodes both bcl-xlong, an inhibitor of apoptosis, and bcl-xshort, an inducer of apoptosis) during gonadotropin-stimulated follicular development in vivo and during atresia of antral follicles incubated in vitro. Complementary DNA fragments corresponding to rat bcl-2, rat bax, and rat bcl-x coding sequences were obtained by the reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) technique using total RNA prepared from immature rat ovaries. Northern blot analysis of steady-state bcl-2, bax, and bcl-x messenger RNA (mRNA) levels in total RNA prepared from ovaries of immature rats before and after in vivo priming with 10 IU equine CG (eCG) revealed that eCG-induced follicular growth and survival were associated with a relatively constitutive level of bcl-2 and bcl-x expression but markedly reduced levels of bax mRNA (29 +/- 5% of saline-treated control animals). Using the RT-PCR technique coupled with Southern blot hybridization analysis to distinguish the long vs. short forms of bcl-x (which differ in size by 189 base pairs), it was determined that bcl-xlong was the predominant message expressed by granulosa cells of eCG-primed ovaries. The eCG-mediated decrease in bax expression, coupled with a maintenance of bcl-2 and bcl-xlong mRNA levels, were associated with a pronounced reduction in the extent of granulosa cell apoptosis. In contrast, the induction of apoptosis in a homogeneous population of healthy antral follicles by incubation in vitro without tropic support was associated with an significant increase in bax mRNA levels to 220 +/- 10% of those detected in freshly isolated, healthy follicles. Moreover, bcl-xlong message levels were significantly reduced in follicles incubated for 24 h to 69 +/- 4% of those levels detected in freshly isolated, healthy follicles.

L. Johnson,J. L. Tilly",Biology of Reproduction,,,Biol Reprod,0006-3363,"Arachidonic acid has been proposed to function as a hormone-induced second messenger in a variety of mammalian endocrine tissues. The present studies were conducted to evaluate whether arachidonic acid, either added exogenously or released endogenously following treatment with physiologic (phospholipase A2) or pharmacologic (melittin) agents, influences basal and/or luteinizing hormone (LH)-induced cyclic adenosine 3′,5′-monophosphate (cAMP) and progesterone production in granulosa cells from domestic hens. Phospholipase A2 (PLA2) and melittin treatments failed to alter basal concentrations of progesterone, whereas arachidonic acid had a slight stimulatory effect (only at the 50-μM dose) on progesterone levels, and no effect on cAMP. By contrast, arachidonic acid, PLA2, and melittin each inhibited LH-promoted progesterone production in a dose-dependent fashion. The inhibitory effects of arachidonic acid on the progesterone response were determined to occur both prior and subsequent to cAMP formation since cAMP levels in arachidonic acid-treated cells were attenuated after treatment with 10 ng LH or 100 μM forskolin (at 10- to 100-μM doses of arachidonic acid), and progesterone production was decreased in the presence of 1 mM 8-bromo-cAMP (with 50 and 100 μM arachidonic acid). The post-cAMP mechanism of action is characterized by the inability of cells to convert 25-hydroxy-cholesterol, but not pregnenolone, to progesterone. The effects of arachidonic acid are probably direct, since pharmacologic inhibitors of the lipoxygenase (nordihydroguaiaretic acid) and cyclooxygenase (indomethacin) pathways of arachidonic acid metabolism failed to alter the suppression of LH-stimulated progesterone production. Furthermore, several related fatty acids (pe,uaenoic, eicosajrienoic, oleic, and palmitoleic acids), which do not enter the cyclooxygenase or lipoxygenase metabolic pathways, replicated this response. We conclude that arachidonic acid may represent an additional second messenger that can modulate LI-I-stimulated steroido genesis in the ovary of the hen.",3,42,458-464

PCa exhibits a unique metabolic rewriting that changes from initial neoplasia to advanced neoplasia. However, systematic and comprehensive studies on the relationship of changes in the metabolic landscape of PCa with tumor recurrence and treatment response are lacking. We aimed to construct a metabolism-related gene landscape that predicts PCa recurrence and treatment response. In the present study, we used differentially expressed gene analysis, protein–protein interaction (PPI) networks, univariate and multivariate Cox regression, and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression to construct and verify a metabolism-related risk model (MRM) to predict the disease-free survival (DFS) and response to treatment for PCa patients. The MRM predicted patient survival more accurately than the current clinical prognostic indicators. By using two independent PCa datasets (International Cancer Genome Consortium (ICGC) PCa and Taylor) and actual patients to test the model, we also confirmed that the metabolism-related risk score (MRS) was strongly related to PCa progression. Notably, patients in different MRS subgroups had significant differences in metabolic activity, mutant landscape, immune microenvironment, and drug sensitivity. Patients in the high-MRS group were more sensitive to immunotherapy and endocrine therapy, while patients in the low-MRS group were more sensitive to chemotherapy. We developed an MRM, which might act as a clinical feature to more accurately assess prognosis and guide the selection of appropriate treatment for PCa patients. It is promising for further application in clinical practice.",,13,837991

DTU was assessed using two transcript-count based approaches, implemented in the DRIMSeq and DEXSeq tools. Multiple PD-associated DTU events were detected in each cohort, of which 23 DTU events in 19 genes replicated across both patient cohorts. For several of these, including THEM5, SLC16A1 and BCHE, DTU was predicted to have substantial functional consequences, such as altered subcellular localization or switching to non-protein coding isoforms. Furthermore, genes with PD-associated DTU were enriched in functional pathways previously linked to PD, including reactive oxygen species generation and protein homeostasis. Importantly, the vast majority of genes exhibiting DTU were not differentially expressed at the gene-level and were therefore not identified by conventional differential gene expression analysis. Our findings provide the first insight into the DTU landscape of PD and identify novel disease-associated genes. Moreover, we show that DTU may have important functional consequences in the PD brain, since it is predicted to alter the functional composition of the proteome. Based on these results, we propose that DTU analysis is an essential complement to differential gene expression studies in order to provide a more accurate and complete picture of disease-associated transcriptomic alterations.",11,16,e1009182

Adv.,,"Alzheimer’s disease (AD), the most common form of dementia, is recognized as a heterogeneous disease with diverse pathophysiologic mechanisms. In this study, we interrogate the molecular heterogeneity of AD by analyzing 1543 transcriptomes across five brain regions in two AD cohorts using an integrative network approach. We identify three major molecular subtypes of AD corresponding to different combinations of multiple dysregulated pathways, such as susceptibility to tau-mediated neurodegeneration, amyloid-β neuroinflammation, synaptic signaling, immune activity, mitochondria organization, and myelination. Multiscale network analysis reveals subtype-specific drivers such as GABRB2, LRP10, MSN, PLP1, and ATP6V1A. We further demonstrate that variations between existing AD mouse models recapitulate a certain degree of subtype heterogeneity, which may partially explain why a vast majority of drugs that succeeded in specific mouse models do not align with generalized human trials across all AD subtypes. Therefore, subtyping patients with AD is a critical step toward precision medicine for this devastating disease.",2,7,eabb5398

We report 25 families containing 34 individuals with neurological disease associated with biallelic HPDL variants. Phenotypes ranged from juvenile-onset pure hereditary spastic paraplegia to infantile-onset spasticity and global developmental delays, sometimes complicated by episodes of neurological and respiratory decompensation. Variants included bona fide pathogenic truncating changes, although most were missense substitutions. Functionality of variants could not be determined directly as the enzymatic specificity of HPDL is unknown; however, when HPDL missense substitutions were introduced into 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase (HPPD, an HPDL orthologue), they impaired the ability of HPPD to convert 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate into homogentisate. Moreover, three additional sets of experiments provided evidence for a role of HPDL in the nervous system and further supported its link to neurological disease: (i) HPDL was expressed in the nervous system and expression increased during neural differentiation; (ii) knockdown of zebrafish hpdl led to abnormal motor behaviour, replicating aspects of the human disease; and (iii) HPDL localized to mitochondria, consistent with mitochondrial disease that is often associated with neurological manifestations. Our findings suggest that biallelic HPDL variants cause a syndrome varying from juvenile-onset pure hereditary spastic paraplegia to infantile-onset spastic tetraplegia associated with global developmental delays.",5,144,1422-1434

This review focuses on new models of therapeutic strategies targeting mitochondrial function in the treatment of heart failure. Therapeutic strategies targeting mitochondria appear to be a valuable option for treating heart failure. Currently, the greatest challenge is to develop new research models that could restore the disrupted metabolic processes in mitochondria as comprehensively as possible. Only the development of therapies that focus on improving as many dysregulated mitochondrial processes as possible in patients with heart failure will be able to bring the expected clinical improvement, along with inhibition of disease progression.

This review discusses molecular mechanisms underlying cardiac hypertrophy with a focus on factors driving the orientation of myocyte growth and the impact on heart function. We highlight recent work showing a novel role for the spectrin-based cytoskeleton, emphasizing regulation of myocyte dimensions but not hypertrophy per se. Finally, we consider opportunities for directing the orientation of myocyte growth in response to hypertrophic stimuli as an alternative therapeutic approach. Relevant publications on the topic were identified through Pubmed with open-ended search dates. To define new therapeutic avenues, more precision is required when describing changes in myocyte and heart structure/function in response to hypertrophic stimuli.

Cole,Current Protocols in Protein Science,,,Curr. Protoc. Protein Sci.,1934-3655,"Site‐specific labeling of cellular proteins with chemical probes is a powerful tool for studying protein function in living cells. A number of small peptide and protein tags have been developed that can be labeled with synthetic probes with high efficiencies and specificities and provide flexibility not available with fluorescent proteins. The SNAP‐tag is a modified form of the DNA repair enzyme human O6‐alkylguanine‐DNA‐alkyltransferase, and undergoes a self‐labeling reaction to form a covalent bond with O6‐benzylguanine (BG) derivatives. BG can be modified with a wide variety of fluorophores and other reporter compounds, generally without affecting the reaction with the SNAP‐tag. In this unit, basic strategies for labeling SNAP‐tag fusion proteins, both for live cell imaging and for in vitro analysis, are described. This includes a description of a releasable SNAP‐tag probe that allows the user to chemically cleave the fluorophore from the labeled SNAP‐tag fusion. In vitro labeling of purified SNAP‐tag fusions is briefly described. Curr. Protoc. Protein Sci. 73:30.1.1‐30.1.16. © 2013 by John Wiley & Sons, Inc.",1,73,30.1.1-30.1.16

Although genetic screening should contribute to deciphering the regulatory networks of lipid metabolism, technical challenges remain—especially for high-throughput readouts of lipid phenotypes. Here, we coupled organelle-selective click labeling of phosphatidylcholine (PC) with flow cytometry-based CRISPR screening technologies to convert organellar PC phenotypes into a simple fluorescence readout for genome-wide screening. This technique, named O-ClickFC, was successfully applied in genome-scale CRISPR-knockout screens to identify previously reported genes associated with PC synthesis (PCYT1A, ACACA), vesicular membrane trafficking (SEC23B, RAB5C), and non-vesicular transport (PITPNB, STARD7). Moreover, we revealed previously uncharacterized roles of FLVCR1 as a choline uptake facilitator, CHEK1 as a post-translational regulator of the PC-synthetic pathway, and CDC50A as responsible for the translocation of PC to the outside of the plasma membrane bilayer. These findings demonstrate the versatility of O-ClickFC as an unprecedented platform for genetic dissection of cellular lipid metabolism.",6,35,1072-1083.e9

However, the functions and dynamics of lipids within cells remain unclear because of a lack of methods to selectively label lipids in specific organelles and trace their movement by live-cell imaging. We describe here a technology for the selective labeling and fluorescence imaging (microscopic or nanoscopic) of phosphatidylcholine in target organelles. This approach involves the metabolic incorporation of azido-choline, followed by a spatially limited bioorthogonal reaction that enables the visualization and quantitative analysis of interorganelle lipid transport in live cells. More importantly, with live-cell imaging, we obtained direct evidence that the autophagosomal membrane originates from the endoplasmic reticulum. This method is simple and robust and is thus powerful for real-time tracing of interorganelle lipid trafficking.   Imaging of phosphatidylcholine, sphingomyelin and their interorganelle lipid transport in live cells, using azido-choline and a spatially limited bioorthogonal tag, suggests that autophagosomal membranes originate from the ER.",12,16,1361-1367

Med.,1078-8956,"Human ALS/FTD patient iPSC-derived neurons are used to uncover mechanisms by which C9ORF72 mutations cause neurodegeneration. An intronic GGGGCC repeat expansion in C9ORF72 is the most common cause of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD), but the pathogenic mechanism of this repeat remains unclear. Using human induced motor neurons (iMNs), we found that repeat-expanded C9ORF72 was haploinsufficient in ALS. We found that C9ORF72 interacted with endosomes and was required for normal vesicle trafficking and lysosomal biogenesis in motor neurons. Repeat expansion reduced C9ORF72 expression, triggering neurodegeneration through two mechanisms: accumulation of glutamate receptors, leading to excitotoxicity, and impaired clearance of neurotoxic dipeptide repeat proteins derived from the repeat expansion. Thus, cooperativity between gain- and loss-of-function mechanisms led to neurodegeneration. Restoring C9ORF72 levels or augmenting its function with constitutively active RAB5 or chemical modulators of RAB5 effectors rescued patient neuron survival and ameliorated neurodegenerative processes in both gain- and loss-of-function C9ORF72 mouse models. Thus, modulating vesicle trafficking was able to rescue neurodegeneration caused by the C9ORF72 repeat expansion. Coupled with rare mutations in ALS2, FIG4, CHMP2B, OPTN and SQSTM1, our results reveal mechanistic convergence on vesicle trafficking in ALS and FTD.",3,24,313-325
